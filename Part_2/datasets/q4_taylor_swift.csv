album,lyric
Taylor Swift,He said the way my blue eyes shined
Taylor Swift,Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
Taylor Swift,"I said, ""That's a lie"""
Taylor Swift,Just a boy in a Chevy truck
Taylor Swift,That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
Taylor Swift,On back roads at night
Taylor Swift,And I was right there beside him all summer long
Taylor Swift,And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone
Taylor Swift,But when you think Tim McGraw
Taylor Swift,I hope you think my favorite song
Taylor Swift,The one we danced to all night long
Taylor Swift,The moon like a spotlight on the lake
Taylor Swift,When you think happiness
Taylor Swift,I hope you think that little black dress
Taylor Swift,Think of my head on your chest
Taylor Swift,And my old faded blue jeans
Taylor Swift,When you think Tim McGraw
Taylor Swift,I hope you think of me
Taylor Swift,September saw a month of tears
Taylor Swift,And thankin' God that you weren't here
Taylor Swift,To see me like that
Taylor Swift,But in a box beneath my bed
Taylor Swift,Is a letter that you never read
Taylor Swift,From three summers back
Taylor Swift,It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
Taylor Swift,"And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe"
Taylor Swift,When you think Tim McGraw
Taylor Swift,I hope you think my favorite song
Taylor Swift,The one we danced to all night long
Taylor Swift,The moon like a spotlight on the lake
Taylor Swift,When you think happiness
Taylor Swift,I hope you think that little black dress
Taylor Swift,Think of my head on your chest
Taylor Swift,And my old faded blue jeans
Taylor Swift,When you think Tim McGraw
Taylor Swift,I hope you think of me
Taylor Swift,And I'm back for the first time since then
Taylor Swift,I'm standin' on your street
Taylor Swift,And there's a letter left on your doorstep
Taylor Swift,And the first thing that you'll read is:
Taylor Swift,"""When you think Tim McGraw"
Taylor Swift,I hope you think my favorite song
Taylor Swift,Someday you'll turn your radio on
Taylor Swift,"I hope it takes you back to that place"""
Taylor Swift,When you think happiness
Taylor Swift,I hope you think that little black dress
Taylor Swift,Think of my head on your chest
Taylor Swift,And my old faded blue jeans
Taylor Swift,When you think Tim McGraw
Taylor Swift,I hope you think of me
Taylor Swift,"Oh, think of me"
Taylor Swift,Mmmm
Taylor Swift,He said the way my blue eyes shined
Taylor Swift,Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
Taylor Swift,"I said, ""That's a lie"""
Taylor Swift,"State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy"
Taylor Swift,I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
Taylor Swift,So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
Taylor Swift,That's fine I'll tell mine that you're gay!
Taylor Swift,By the way...
Taylor Swift,I hate that stupid old pickup truck
Taylor Swift,You never let me drive
Taylor Swift,You're a redneck heartbreak
Taylor Swift,Who's really bad at lying
Taylor Swift,So watch me strike a match
Taylor Swift,On all my wasted time
Taylor Swift,As far as I'm concerned
Taylor Swift,You're just another picture to burn!
Taylor Swift,There's no time for tears
Taylor Swift,I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
Taylor Swift,There's nothing stopping me
Taylor Swift,From going out with all of your best friends
Taylor Swift,And if you come around saying sorry to me
Taylor Swift,My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be
Taylor Swift,'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
Taylor Swift,You never let me drive
Taylor Swift,You're a redneck heartbreak
Taylor Swift,Who's really bad at lying
Taylor Swift,So watch me strike a match
Taylor Swift,On all my wasted time
Taylor Swift,As far as I'm concerned
Taylor Swift,You're just another picture to burn!
Taylor Swift,And if you're missing me
Taylor Swift,You'd better keep it to yourself
Taylor Swift,'Cause coming back around here
Taylor Swift,Would be bad for your health...
Taylor Swift,'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
Taylor Swift,You never let me drive
Taylor Swift,You're a redneck heartbreak
Taylor Swift,Who's really bad at lying
Taylor Swift,So watch me strike a match
Taylor Swift,On all my wasted time
Taylor Swift,In case you haven't heard
Taylor Swift,I really really hate that...
Taylor Swift,Stupid old pickup truck
Taylor Swift,You never let me drive
Taylor Swift,You're a redneck heartbreak
Taylor Swift,Who's really bad at lying
Taylor Swift,So watch me strike a match
Taylor Swift,On all my wasted time
Taylor Swift,As far as I'm concerned
Taylor Swift,You're just another picture to burn!
Taylor Swift,"Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn"
Taylor Swift,You're just another picture to burn
Taylor Swift,"Baby, burn..."
Taylor Swift,Drew looks at me
Taylor Swift,I fake a smile so he won't see
Taylor Swift,That I want and I'm needing
Taylor Swift,Everything that we should be
Taylor Swift,"I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about"
Taylor Swift,And she's got everything that I have to live without
Taylor Swift,Drew talks to me
Taylor Swift,I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
Taylor Swift,That I can't even see
Taylor Swift,Anyone when he's with me
Taylor Swift,"He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right"
Taylor Swift,I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
Taylor Swift,He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
Taylor Swift,The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Taylor Swift,He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do
Taylor Swift,Drew walks by me
Taylor Swift,Can he tell that I can't breathe?
Taylor Swift,"And there he goes, so perfectly"
Taylor Swift,The kind of flawless I wish I could be
Taylor Swift,"She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love"
Taylor Swift,Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause
Taylor Swift,He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
Taylor Swift,The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Taylor Swift,He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do
Taylor Swift,"So, I drive home alone"
Taylor Swift,As I turn out the light
Taylor Swift,I'll put his picture down
Taylor Swift,And maybe get some sleep tonight
Taylor Swift,'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
Taylor Swift,The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
Taylor Swift,He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do
Taylor Swift,"He's the time taken up, but there's never enough"
Taylor Swift,And he's all that I need to fall into
Taylor Swift,Drew looks at me
Taylor Swift,I fake a smile so he won't see
Taylor Swift,"I don't know what I want, so don't ask me"
Taylor Swift,'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Taylor Swift,"Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking"
Taylor Swift,Trying to see through the rain coming down
Taylor Swift,Even though I'm not the only one
Taylor Swift,Who feels the way I do
Taylor Swift,"I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know"
Taylor Swift,"I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on"
Taylor Swift,"Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world"
Taylor Swift,"Got the radio on, my old blue jeans"
Taylor Swift,And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Taylor Swift,"Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine"
Taylor Swift,Could you tell me what more do I need
Taylor Swift,"And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah"
Taylor Swift,But that's OK
Taylor Swift,"I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know"
Taylor Swift,"I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on"
Taylor Swift,"Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world"
Taylor Swift,Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
Taylor Swift,But I'm ready to fly
Taylor Swift,"I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know"
Taylor Swift,"I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on"
Taylor Swift,"Oh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know"
Taylor Swift,"Oh I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world"
Taylor Swift,Oh I'm just a girl
Taylor Swift,"Oh I'm just a girl, oh, oh"
Taylor Swift,Oh I'm just a girl
Taylor Swift,You have a way of coming easily to me
Taylor Swift,"And when you take, you take the very best of me"
Taylor Swift,So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
Taylor Swift,And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted
Taylor Swift,"Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day"
Taylor Swift,"Just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say"
Taylor Swift,And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
Taylor Swift,I've never been anywhere cold as you
Taylor Swift,You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
Taylor Swift,And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
Taylor Swift,And you come away with a great little story
Taylor Swift,Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
Taylor Swift,"Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day"
Taylor Swift,"So just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say"
Taylor Swift,And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
Taylor Swift,I've never been anywhere cold as you
Taylor Swift,"You never did give a damn thing, honey, but I cried, cried for you"
Taylor Swift,"And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you, died for you"
Taylor Swift,"Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day"
Taylor Swift,Every smile you fake is so condescending counting all the scars you made
Taylor Swift,And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
Taylor Swift,I've never been anywhere cold as you
Taylor Swift,I didn't know what I would find
Taylor Swift,When I went looking for a reason
Taylor Swift,I know I didn't read between the lines
Taylor Swift,"And, baby, I've got nowhere to go"
Taylor Swift,I tried to take the road less traveled by
Taylor Swift,But nothing seems to work the first few times
Taylor Swift,Am I right?
Taylor Swift,So how can I ever try to be better?
Taylor Swift,Nobody ever lets me in
Taylor Swift,I can still see you
Taylor Swift,This ain't the best view
Taylor Swift,On the outside looking in
Taylor Swift,And I've been a lot of lonely places
Taylor Swift,I've never been on the outside
Taylor Swift,"You saw me there, but never knew"
Taylor Swift,That I would give it all up to be
Taylor Swift,"A part of this, a part of you"
Taylor Swift,And now it's all too late. So you see
Taylor Swift,You could've helped if you had wanted to
Taylor Swift,But no one notices until it's too late to do anything
Taylor Swift,So how can I ever try to be better?
Taylor Swift,Nobody ever lets me in
Taylor Swift,I can still see you
Taylor Swift,This ain't the best view
Taylor Swift,On the outside looking in
Taylor Swift,And I've been a lot of lonely places
Taylor Swift,I've never been on the outside
Taylor Swift,"Oh, yeah"
Taylor Swift,So how can I ever try to be better?
Taylor Swift,Nobody ever lets me in
Taylor Swift,And I can still see you
Taylor Swift,This ain't the best view
Taylor Swift,On the outside looking in
Taylor Swift,And I've been a lot of lonely places
Taylor Swift,I've never been on the outside
Taylor Swift,Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Taylor Swift,Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
Taylor Swift,You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
Taylor Swift,But that's not true 'cause I know you
Taylor Swift,"Hold on, baby, you're losing it"
Taylor Swift,"The water's high, you're jumping into it"
Taylor Swift,And letting go
Taylor Swift,And no one knows
Taylor Swift,"That you cry, but you don't tell anyone"
Taylor Swift,That you might not be the golden one
Taylor Swift,And you're tied together with a smile
Taylor Swift,But you're coming undone
Taylor Swift,I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
Taylor Swift,'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Taylor Swift,Hoping it will end up in his pocket
Taylor Swift,But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Taylor Swift,"Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay"
Taylor Swift,It's not his price to pay
Taylor Swift,"Hold on, baby, you're losing it"
Taylor Swift,"The water's high, you're jumping into it"
Taylor Swift,And letting go
Taylor Swift,And no one knows
Taylor Swift,"That you cry, but you don't tell anyone"
Taylor Swift,That you might not be the golden one
Taylor Swift,And you're tied together with a smile
Taylor Swift,But you're coming undone
Taylor Swift,"Hold on, baby, you're losing it"
Taylor Swift,"The water's high, you're jumping into it"
Taylor Swift,And letting go
Taylor Swift,And no one knows
Taylor Swift,"That you cry, but you don't tell anyone"
Taylor Swift,That you might not be the golden one
Taylor Swift,And you're tied together with a smile
Taylor Swift,But you're coming undone
Taylor Swift,You're tied together with a smile
Taylor Swift,But you're coming undone
Taylor Swift,"Goodbye, baby"
Taylor Swift,"With a smile, baby, baby"
Taylor Swift,Cory's eyes are like a jungle
Taylor Swift,"He smiles, it's like the radio"
Taylor Swift,He whispers songs into my window
Taylor Swift,In words that nobody knows
Taylor Swift,There's pretty girls on every corner
Taylor Swift,That watch him as he's walking home
Taylor Swift,"Saying, ""Does he know?"""
Taylor Swift,Will you ever know?
Taylor Swift,You're beautiful
Taylor Swift,Every little piece love
Taylor Swift,And don't you know
Taylor Swift,You're really gonna be someone
Taylor Swift,Ask anyone
Taylor Swift,And when you find everything you looked for
Taylor Swift,I hope your life leads you back to my door
Taylor Swift,"Oh, but if it don't"
Taylor Swift,Stay beautiful
Taylor Swift,Cory finds another way to be
Taylor Swift,The highlight of my day
Taylor Swift,I'm taking pictures in my mind
Taylor Swift,So I can save them for a rainy day
Taylor Swift,It's hard to make a conversation
Taylor Swift,When he's taking my breath away
Taylor Swift,"I should say, hey, by the way"
Taylor Swift,You're beautiful
Taylor Swift,Every little piece love
Taylor Swift,And don't you know
Taylor Swift,You're really gonna be someone
Taylor Swift,Ask anyone
Taylor Swift,And when you find everything you looked for
Taylor Swift,I hope your life leads you back to my door
Taylor Swift,"Oh, but if it don't"
Taylor Swift,Stay beautiful
Taylor Swift,If you and I are a story
Taylor Swift,That never gets told
Taylor Swift,If what you are is a daydream
Taylor Swift,I'll never get to hold
Taylor Swift,At least you'll know
Taylor Swift,You're beautiful
Taylor Swift,Every little piece love
Taylor Swift,And don't you know
Taylor Swift,You're really gonna be someone
Taylor Swift,Ask anyone
Taylor Swift,And when you find everything you looked for
Taylor Swift,I hope your life leads you back to my front door
Taylor Swift,"Oh, but if it don't"
Taylor Swift,Will you stay
Taylor Swift,"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful"
Taylor Swift,"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?"
Taylor Swift,La la la
Taylor Swift,"Oh, oh, oh, oh"
Taylor Swift,"Oh, but if it don't"
Taylor Swift,Stay beautiful
Taylor Swift,Stay beautiful
Taylor Swift,"Na, na, na, na, na"
Taylor Swift,It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
Taylor Swift,"The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone"
Taylor Swift,Yesterday I found out about you
Taylor Swift,Even now just looking at you feels wrong
Taylor Swift,"You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance"
Taylor Swift,"It was a moment of weakness and you said, ""Yes."""
Taylor Swift,"You should've said ""No"", you should've gone home"
Taylor Swift,You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
Taylor Swift,You should've known that word
Taylor Swift,'Bout what you did with her'd
Taylor Swift,Get back to me (get back to me).
Taylor Swift,And I should've been there in the back of your mind
Taylor Swift,"I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?"""
Taylor Swift,You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
Taylor Swift,"You should've said ""No"", baby, and you might still have me"
Taylor Swift,You can see that I've been crying
Taylor Swift,"And baby, you know all the right things to say"
Taylor Swift,But do you honestly expect me to believe
Taylor Swift,We could ever be the same?
Taylor Swift,"You say that the past is the past, you need one chance"
Taylor Swift,"It was a moment of weakness and you said, ""Yes."""
Taylor Swift,"You should've said ""No"", you should've gone home"
Taylor Swift,You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
Taylor Swift,You should've known that word
Taylor Swift,"'Bout what you did with her'd,"
Taylor Swift,Get back to me (get back to me).
Taylor Swift,And I should've been there in the back of your mind
Taylor Swift,"I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?"""
Taylor Swift,You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
Taylor Swift,"You should've said ""No"", baby, and you might still have me"
Taylor Swift,I can't resist
Taylor Swift,"Before you go, tell me this:"
Taylor Swift,Was it worth it?
Taylor Swift,Was she worth this?
Taylor Swift,"No... no, no, no..."
Taylor Swift,"You should've said ""No"", you should've gone home"
Taylor Swift,You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
Taylor Swift,You should've known that word
Taylor Swift,"'Bout what you did with her'd,"
Taylor Swift,Get back to me (get back to me).
Taylor Swift,And I should've been there in the back of your mind
Taylor Swift,"I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?"""
Taylor Swift,You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
Taylor Swift,"You should've said ""No"", baby, and you might still have me"
Taylor Swift,"She said, I was seven and you were nine"
Taylor Swift,I looked at you like the stars that shined
Taylor Swift,"In the sky, the pretty lights"
Taylor Swift,And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Taylor Swift,Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
Taylor Swift,"And rolled their eyes and said, ""Oh my, my, my"""
Taylor Swift,Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Taylor Swift,"Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me"
Taylor Swift,"You never did, you never did"
Taylor Swift,Take me back when our world was one block wide
Taylor Swift,I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Taylor Swift,"Just two kids, you and I"
Taylor Swift,"Oh my, my, my, my"
Taylor Swift,"Well, I was sixteen when suddenly"
Taylor Swift,I wasn't that little girl you used to see
Taylor Swift,But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
Taylor Swift,And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Taylor Swift,They never believed we'd really fall in love
Taylor Swift,And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
Taylor Swift,"And said, ""Oh my, my, my"""
Taylor Swift,Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
Taylor Swift,"Two A.M. riding in your truck, and all I need is you next to me"
Taylor Swift,Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
Taylor Swift,The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
Taylor Swift,You stayed outside 'til the morning light
Taylor Swift,"Oh my, my, my, my"
Taylor Swift,A few years had gone and come around
Taylor Swift,We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
Taylor Swift,"And you looked at me, got down on one knee"
Taylor Swift,Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Taylor Swift,Our whole town came and our mamas cried
Taylor Swift,"You said ""I do"" and I did too"
Taylor Swift,Take me home where we met so many years before
Taylor Swift,We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
Taylor Swift,"After all this time, you and I"
Taylor Swift,I'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine
Taylor Swift,I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
Taylor Swift,"In the sky, oh my, my, my"
Taylor Swift,I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
Taylor Swift,In the front seat of his car
Taylor Swift,He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
Taylor Swift,The other on my heart
Taylor Swift,"I look around, turn the radio down"
Taylor Swift,"He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?"""
Taylor Swift,"I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin'"
Taylor Swift,"How we don't have a song"""
Taylor Swift,And he says
Taylor Swift,Our song is the slamming screen door
Taylor Swift,"Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window"
Taylor Swift,When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
Taylor Swift,'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Taylor Swift,Our song is the way you laugh
Taylor Swift,"The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"""
Taylor Swift,And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Taylor Swift,Asking God if he could play it again
Taylor Swift,I was walking up the front porch steps
Taylor Swift,After everything that day
Taylor Swift,Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
Taylor Swift,And lost and thrown away
Taylor Swift,"Got to the hallway, well on my way"
Taylor Swift,To my lovin' bed
Taylor Swift,I almost didn't notice all the roses
Taylor Swift,And the note that said
Taylor Swift,Our song is the slamming screen door
Taylor Swift,"Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window"
Taylor Swift,When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
Taylor Swift,'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Taylor Swift,Our song is the way you laugh
Taylor Swift,"The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"""
Taylor Swift,And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Taylor Swift,Asking God if he could play it again
Taylor Swift,Da-da-da-da
Taylor Swift,"I've heard every album, listened to the radio"
Taylor Swift,Waited for somethin' to come along
Taylor Swift,That was as good as our song
Taylor Swift,'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Taylor Swift,"Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window"
Taylor Swift,When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
Taylor Swift,'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Taylor Swift,Our song is the way he laughs
Taylor Swift,"The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"""
Taylor Swift,And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Taylor Swift,Asking God if he could play it again
Taylor Swift,"Play it again, oh, yeah"
Taylor Swift,"Oh, oh, yeah"
Taylor Swift,I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
Taylor Swift,In the front seat of his car
Taylor Swift,I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
Taylor Swift,And I wrote down our song
Taylor Swift,Friday night beneath the stars
Taylor Swift,In a field behind your yard
Taylor Swift,You and I are painting pictures in the sky
Taylor Swift,And sometimes we don't say a thing
Taylor Swift,Just listen to the crickets sing
Taylor Swift,Everything I need is right here by my side
Taylor Swift,And I know everything about you
Taylor Swift,I don't wanna live without you
Taylor Swift,I'm only up when you're not down
Taylor Swift,Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
Taylor Swift,It's like no matter what I do
Taylor Swift,"Well, you drive me crazy half the time"
Taylor Swift,"The other half, I'm only tryna"
Taylor Swift,Let you know that what I feel is true
Taylor Swift,And I'm only me when I'm with you
Taylor Swift,Just a small-town boy and girl
Taylor Swift,Living in a crazy world
Taylor Swift,Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
Taylor Swift,And I don't try to hide my tears
Taylor Swift,My secrets or my deepest fears
Taylor Swift,Through it all nobody gets me like you do
Taylor Swift,And you know everything about me
Taylor Swift,You say that you can't live without me
Taylor Swift,I'm only up when you're not down
Taylor Swift,Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
Taylor Swift,It's like no matter what I do
Taylor Swift,"Well, you drive me crazy half the time"
Taylor Swift,"The other half, I'm only tryna"
Taylor Swift,Let you know that what I feel is true
Taylor Swift,And I'm only me when I'm with you
Taylor Swift,When I'm with anybody else
Taylor Swift,It's so hard to be myself
Taylor Swift,And only you can tell
Taylor Swift,That I'm only up when you're not down
Taylor Swift,Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
Taylor Swift,It's like no matter what I do
Taylor Swift,"Well, you drive me crazy half the time"
Taylor Swift,"The other half, I'm only tryna"
Taylor Swift,Let you know that what I feel is true
Taylor Swift,"And I'm only me, who I wanna be"
Taylor Swift,"Well, I'm only me when I'm with you"
Taylor Swift,With you
Taylor Swift,"Uh-huh, yeah"
Taylor Swift,She can't see the way your eyes
Taylor Swift,Light up when you smile
Taylor Swift,She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Taylor Swift,Whenever she walks by
Taylor Swift,And you can't see me wanting you the way you want her
Taylor Swift,But you are everything to me
Taylor Swift,And I just wanna show you
Taylor Swift,She don't even know you
Taylor Swift,She's never gonna love you like I want to
Taylor Swift,And you just see right through me
Taylor Swift,But if you only knew me
Taylor Swift,We could be a beautiful
Taylor Swift,Miracle
Taylor Swift,Unbelievable
Taylor Swift,Instead of just invisible
Taylor Swift,"Oh, yeah"
Taylor Swift,There's a fire inside of you
Taylor Swift,That can't help but shine through
Taylor Swift,She's never gonna see the light
Taylor Swift,No matter what you do
Taylor Swift,And all I think about is how to make you think of me
Taylor Swift,And everything that we could be
Taylor Swift,I just wanna show you
Taylor Swift,She don't even know you
Taylor Swift,She's never gonna love you like I want to
Taylor Swift,And you just see right through me
Taylor Swift,If you only knew me
Taylor Swift,We could be a beautiful
Taylor Swift,Miracle
Taylor Swift,Unbelievable
Taylor Swift,Instead of just invisible
Taylor Swift,Like shadows in a faded light
Taylor Swift,"Oh, we're invisible"
Taylor Swift,I just wanna open your eyes
Taylor Swift,And make you realize
Taylor Swift,I just wanna show you
Taylor Swift,She don't even know you
Taylor Swift,"Baby, let me love you"
Taylor Swift,Let me want you
Taylor Swift,You just see right through me
Taylor Swift,But if you only knew me
Taylor Swift,We could be a beautiful
Taylor Swift,Miracle
Taylor Swift,Unbelievable
Taylor Swift,Instead of just invisible
Taylor Swift,"Oh, yeah"
Taylor Swift,She can't see the way your eyes
Taylor Swift,Light up when you smile
Taylor Swift,Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Taylor Swift,"Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?"
Taylor Swift,Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Taylor Swift,Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Taylor Swift,Maybe I should've seen the signs
Taylor Swift,Should've read the writing on the wall
Taylor Swift,And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall
Taylor Swift,"No matter what you say, I still can't believe"
Taylor Swift,That you would walk away
Taylor Swift,"It don't make sense to me, but"
Taylor Swift,Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Taylor Swift,"Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?"
Taylor Swift,Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Taylor Swift,Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Taylor Swift,It's not unbroken anymore
Taylor Swift,How do I get it back the way it was before?
Taylor Swift,Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Taylor Swift,"Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?"
Taylor Swift,Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Taylor Swift,Why would you wanna break? Why would you wanna break it?
Taylor Swift,Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Taylor Swift,"Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?"
Taylor Swift,Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Taylor Swift,Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Taylor Swift,Drew looks at me
Taylor Swift,I fake a smile so he won't see
Taylor Swift,What I want and I need
Taylor Swift,And everything that we should be
Taylor Swift,I'll bet she's beautiful
Taylor Swift,That girl he talks about
Taylor Swift,And she's got everything
Taylor Swift,That I have to live without
Taylor Swift,Drew talks to me
Taylor Swift,I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
Taylor Swift,But I can't even see
Taylor Swift,Anyone when he's with me
Taylor Swift,He says he's so in love
Taylor Swift,He's finally got it right
Taylor Swift,I wonder if he knows
Taylor Swift,He's all I think about at night
Taylor Swift,He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
Taylor Swift,The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Taylor Swift,He's the song in the car I keep singing
Taylor Swift,Don't know why I do
Taylor Swift,Drew walks by me
Taylor Swift,Can he tell that I can't breathe?
Taylor Swift,"And there he goes, so perfectly"
Taylor Swift,The kind of flawless I wish I could be
Taylor Swift,She better hold him tight
Taylor Swift,Give him all her love
Taylor Swift,Look in those beautiful eyes
Taylor Swift,And know she's lucky 'cause
Taylor Swift,He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
Taylor Swift,The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Taylor Swift,He's the song in the car I keep singing
Taylor Swift,Don't know why I do
Taylor Swift,So I drive home alone
Taylor Swift,As I turn out the light
Taylor Swift,I'll put his picture down
Taylor Swift,And maybe get some sleep tonight
Taylor Swift,'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
Taylor Swift,The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
Taylor Swift,He's the song in the car I keep singing
Taylor Swift,Don't know why I do
Taylor Swift,"He's the time taken up, but there's never enough"
Taylor Swift,And he's all that I need to fall into
Taylor Swift,Drew looks at me
Taylor Swift,I fake a smile so he won't see
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),There's something 'bout the way
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),The street looks when it's just rained
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"In the middle of the parking lot, yeah"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Oh, yeah"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Absent-mindedly making me want you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And I don't know how it gets better than this
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"In a storm in my best dress, fеarless"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this onе-horse town"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You put your eyes on me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"In this moment now, capture it, remember it"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"In a storm in my best dress, fearless"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Oh, oh"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Well, you stood there with me in the doorway"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It's fearless
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Oh, yeah"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"In a storm in my best dress, fearless"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"In a storm in my best dress, fearless"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Oh, oh"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Oh-oh, yeah"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It's the mornin' of your very first day
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Try and stay out of everybody's way
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),For the next four years in this town
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"""You know, I haven't seen you around before"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You're gonna believe them
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Well, count to ten, take it in"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),At fifteen
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And soon enough, you're best friends"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),We'll be outta here as soon as we can
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And you're feelin' like flyin'
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),When the night ends
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You're gonna believe them
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Makes your head spin around, well"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),In your life you'll do things greater than
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Datin' the boy on the football team
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I didn't know it at fifteen
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),When all you wanted was to be wanted
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And Abigail gave everything she had
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),To a boy who changed his mind
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And we both cried
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You're gonna believe them
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But I've found time can heal most anything
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And you just might find who you're supposed to be
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I didn't know who I was supposed to be
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),At fifteen
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"La-la-la, la-la-la"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Your very first day
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Take a deep breath, girl"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),We were both young when I first saw you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I close my eyes and the flashback starts
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I'm standing there
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),On a balcony in summer air
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),See you make your way through the crowd
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And say, ""Hello"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Little did I know
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And I was crying on the staircase
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),So I sneak out to the garden to see you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),So close your eyes
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But you were everything to me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"This love is difficult, but it's real"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Oh, oh"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And I got tired of waiting
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Wondering if you were ever coming around
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),My faith in you was fading
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),When I met you on the outskirts of town
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I keep waiting for you, but you never come"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I love you and that's all I really know
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Oh, oh, oh"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Oh, oh, oh"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Mmm-mm, mm-mm"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Mmm-mm, mm-mm"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But I know I saw a light in you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And as we walked we were talking
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believing"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I don't always have to be alone
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Can't help it if there's no one else
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Mmm, I can't help myself"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),So I got some things to say to you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I've seen it all, so I thought"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving?"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I think you and I should stay the same
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Can't help it if there's no one else
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Mmm, I can't help myself"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Why aren't you here tonight?
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And pull me near and shine, shine, shine"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Why I should be the one you choose
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"All those other girls, well, they're beautiful"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But would they write a song for you? (Ha-ha-ha)
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I can't help it if you look like an angel
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Can't help it if there's no one else
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Mmm, I can't help myself"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),If you look like an angel
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Can't help it if there's no one else
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Mmm, I can't help myself"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Ah-uh, myself"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Mmm-mm, I can't help myself"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I can't help myself
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Oh-oh-oh
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Mmm-mm, mm-mm"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Mmm-mm, mm-mm"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Mmm-mm, mm-mm"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Say you're sorry, that face of an angel"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Comes out just when you need it to
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),As I paced back and forth all this time
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),'Cause I honestly believed in you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Holdin' on, the days drag on"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Now it's too late for you and your white horse
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),To come around
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Maybe I was naïve, got lost in your eyes"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And never really had a chance
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"My mistake, I didn't know to bе in love"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You had to fight to have the uppеr hand
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I had so many dreams about you and me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Happy endings, now I know"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Now it's too late for you and your white horse
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),To come around
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And there you are on your knees
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Just like I always wanted
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But I'm so sorry
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I'm gonna find someone someday
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Who might actually treat me well
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"This is a big world, that was a small town"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),There in my rearview mirror disappearing now
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And it's too late for you and your white horse
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Now it's too late for you and your white horse
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),To catch me now
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Try and catch me now, oh"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It's too late to catch me now
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),She's going off about something that you said
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And she'll never know your story like I do
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),If you could see that I'm the onе who understands you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Been here all along, so why can't you see?"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You bеlong with me, you belong with me"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Hey, isn't this easy?"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You say you're fine, I know you better than that"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"She wears high heels, I wear sneakers"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Been here all along, so why can't you see?"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You belong with me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Standing by and waiting at your back door
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"All this time how could you not know, baby?"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You belong with me, you belong with me"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Oh, I remember you driving to my house"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),In the middle of the night
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I'm the one who makes you laugh
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),When you know you're 'bout to cry
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I know your favorite songs
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Think I know where you belong
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Think I know it's with me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Been here all along, so why can't you see?"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You belong with me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Standing by and waiting at your back door
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"All this time how could you not know, baby?"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You belong with me, you belong with me"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You belong with me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Have you ever thought just maybe
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You belong with me?
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You belong with me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I see your face in my mind as I drive away
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),People are people and sometimes we change our minds
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But it's killing me to see you go after all this time
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),The music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Now I don't know what to be without you around
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And we know it's never simple, never easy"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Never a clean break, no one here to save me"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And I can't breathe without you, but I have to"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Breathe without you, but I have to"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And nothin' we say is gonna save us from the fallout
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And we know it's never simple, never easy"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Never a clean break, no one here to save me"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And I can't breathe without you, but I have to"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Breathe without you but I have to
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"It's 2 A.M., feeling like I just lost a friend"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"It's 2 A.M., feeling like I just lost a friend"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And we know it's never simple, never easy"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I can't breathe without you, but I have to"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Breathe without you, but I have to"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Breathe without you, but I have to"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Breathe without you, but I have to"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Mmm)"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I'm sorry, (Yeah, yeah) I'm sorry"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Ooh, ooh)"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I'm sorry
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I took a chance, I took a shot"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You took a swing, I took it hard"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And down here from the ground, I see who you are"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I'm sick and tired of your attitude
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I'm feeling like I don't know you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You tell me that you love me, then cut me down"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And I need you like a heartbeat
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But you know you got a mean streak
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Makes me run for cover when you're around
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Here's to you and your temper
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Yes, I remember what you said last night"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And I know that you see what you're doin' to me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Tell me why
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Well, you could write a book on"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),How to ruin someone's perfеct day
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Well, I get so confused and frustratеd"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Forget what I'm tryin' to say, oh"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I'm sick and tired of your reasons
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I got no one to believe in
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You tell me that you want me, then push me around"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And I need you like a heartbeat
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But you know you got a mean streak
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Makes me run for cover when you're around
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Here's to you and your temper
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Yes, I remember what you said last night"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And I know that you see what you're doin' to me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Tell me why
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Why do you have to make me feel small
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),So you can feel whole inside?
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Why do you have to put down my dreams
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),So you're the only thing on my mind?
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I'm sick and tired of your attitude
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Feeling like I don't know you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You tell me that you want me, then cut me down"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I'm sick and tired of your reasons
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I've got no one to believe in
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You ask me for my love, then you push me around"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Here's to you and your temper
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Yes, I remember what you said last night"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And I know that you see what you're doin' to me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Tell me why (Why)
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Tell me why (Oh)
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I take a step back, I let you go"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I told you I'm not bulletproof
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Now you know
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You don't have to call anymore
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I won't pick up the phone
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),This is the last straw
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Don't wanna hurt anymore
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And you can tell me that you're sorry
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You're not sorry
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"No, no, oh-oh"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't lеft me waiting in the cold
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And you've got your sharе of secrets
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And I'm tired of being last to know, oh"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And now you're asking me to listen
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),'Cause it's worked each time before
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But you don't have to call anymore
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I won't pick up the phone
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),This is the last straw
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Don't wanna hurt anymore
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And you can tell me that you're sorry
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You're not sorry
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"No, no, oh-oh"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You're not sorry
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"No, no, oh-oh"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You had me crawling for you, honey"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And it never would've gone away, no"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),So you don't have to call anymore
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I won't pick up the phone
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),This is the last straw
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),There's nothing left to beg for
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And you can tell me that you're sorry

Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Woah, oh, oh oh, oh oh oh"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),He is sensible and so incredible
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And all my single friends are jealous
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),He says everything I need to hear and it's like
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I couldn't ask for anything better
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),He opens up my door and I get into his car
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And he says, ""You look beautiful tonight"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And I feel perfectly fine
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You're so in love that you act insane
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And that's the way I loved you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Breaking down and coming undone
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It's a rollercoaster kind of rush
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And I never knew I could feel that much
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And that's the way I loved you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),He respects my space
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And never makes me wait
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And he calls exactly when he says he will
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),He's close to my mother
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Talks business with my father
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),He's charming and endearing
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And I'm comfortable
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You're so in love that you acted insane
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And that's the way I loved you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Breaking down and coming undone
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It's a rollercoaster kind of rush
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And I never knew I could feel that much
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And that's the way I loved you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),He can't see the smile I'm faking
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And my heart's not breaking
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And you were wild and crazy
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Just so frustrating
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Intoxicating, complicated"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Got away by some mistake and now
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I'm so in love that I acted insane
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And that's the way I loved you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Breaking down and coming undone
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It's a rollercoaster kind of rush
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And I never knew I could feel that much
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And that's the way I loved you oh, oh"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Whoa, whoa, oh-oh, oh"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And that's the way I loved you oh, oh, oh, oh"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Oh, oh, oh, whoa"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Never knew I could feel that much
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And that's the way I loved you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Once upon a time
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And we caught onto something
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I hold onto the night
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Were you just kidding?
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),'Cause it seems to me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I don't feel welcome anymore
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Baby, what happened? Please tell me"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),'Cause one second it was perfect
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Now you're halfway out the door
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And you flashback to when he said, ""forever and always"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Oh, and it rains in your bedroom"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Everything is wrong
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"'Cause I was there when you said, ""forever and always"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Was I out of line?
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Like a scared little boy?
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I looked into your eyes
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Where is this going?
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And you flashback to when he said, ""forever and always"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Oh, and it rains in your bedroom"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Everything is wrong
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"'Cause I was there when you said, ""forever and always"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Oh, back up, baby, back up"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Did you forget everything?
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Back up, baby, back up"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Did you forget everything?
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Everything is wrong
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"'Cause I was there when you said, ""forever and always"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called"

Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"'Cause I was there when you said, ""forever and always"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You didn't mean it baby
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You said, ""forever and always,"" yeah"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Look now, the sky is gold"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But I know I had the best day with you today
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I'm thirteen now
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And don't know how my friends could be so mean
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But I know I had the best day with you today
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"God smiles on my little brother, inside and out"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),He's better than I am
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And I had the best days with you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),There is a video I found from back when I was three
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarves
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Daddy's smart
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And I love you for giving me your eyes
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),For staying back and watching me shine
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),That I had the best day with you today
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Well, it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You know it’s all the same, another time and place"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But I believe in whatever you do
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And I'll do anything to see it through
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Because these things will change
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Can you feel it now?
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"This revolution, the time will come"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),For us to finally win
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And we’ll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Oh, oh"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"So we've been outnumbered, raidеd, and now cornered"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It's hard to fight when thе fight ain't fair
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"We're getting stronger now, find things they never found"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You can walk away, say we don't need this"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But there’s something in your eyes says we can beat this
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),’Cause these things will change
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Can you feel it now?
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"This revolution, the time will come"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),For us to finally win
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And we'll sing hallelujah, we’ll sing hallelujah"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Oh, oh"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Tonight, we'll stand, get off our knees"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Fight for what we've worked for all these years
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But we’ll stand up champions tonight
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It was the night things changed
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Can you see it now?
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),When the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"It's a revolution, throw your hands up"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),'Cause we never gave in
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Hallelujah
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I like the way you sound in the morning
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),We're on the phone and without a warning
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I realize your laugh is the best sound
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I have ever heard
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I like the way I can't keep my focus
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I watch you talk, you didn't notice"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I hear the words but all I can think is
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),We should be together
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Every time you smile, I smile"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And every time you shine, I'll shine for you"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Whoa oh, I'm feeling you, baby"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Don't be afraid to
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Jump then fall
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Jump then fall into me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Baby, I'm never gonna leave you"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Say that you wanna be with me too
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),'Cause I'ma stay through it all
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),So jump then fall
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You got the keys to me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I love each freckle on your face, oh"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I've never been so wrapped up, honey"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I had time to think it over
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And all I can say is come closer
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Cause every time you smile, I smile"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And every time you shine, I'll shine for you"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Whoa oh, I'm feeling you, baby"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Don't be afraid to
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Jump then fall
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Jump then fall into me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Baby, I'm never gonna leave you"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Say that you wanna be with me too
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),'Cause I'ma stay through it all
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),So jump then fall
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I'll catch you, I'll catch you"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),When people say things that bring you to your knees
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I'll catch you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But I'll hold you through the night until you smile
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Whoa oh, I need you, baby"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Don't be afraid, please"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Jump then fall
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Jump then fall into me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Baby, I'm never gonna leave you"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Say that you wanna be with me too
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),'Cause I'ma stay through it all
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),So jump then fall
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Jump then fall, baby"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Jump then fall into me, into me"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Every time you smile, I smile"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And every time you shine, I shine"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And every time you're here
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Baby, I'll show you, I'll show you"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You can jump then fall, jump then fall"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And when you're close, I feel like coming undone"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Come on, come on, little taste of heaven"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It's half full and I won't wait here all day
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And now that you're close, I feel like coming undone"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Come on, come on, oh"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),In the middle of the night waking from this dream
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Come on, come on, little taste of heaven"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I'm caught up in you

Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"So dim that spotlight, tell me things like"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I can't take my eyes off of you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Who's desperately in love with you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You played in bars, you play guitar"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Every night from the radio
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"So dim that spotlight, tell me things like"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I can't take my eyes off of you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Who's desperately in love with you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Sweet, sweet superstar"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Superstar
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),In the heat of the fight I walked away
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Ignorin' words that you were sayin'
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Tryna make me stay
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I said, ""This time I've had enough"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And you've called a hundred times
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But I'm not picking up
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But if you look a little closer
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Screamin', ""I'm in love with you"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And don't you leave 'cause I know
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),All I need is on the other side of the door
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Me and my stupid pride are sittin' here alone
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Goin' through the photographs, starin' at the phone"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I keep goin' back over things we both said
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And I remember the slamming door
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And all the things that I misread
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Oh, babe, if you know everything"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Tell me why you couldn't see
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"When I left, I wanted you to chase after me, yeah"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Screamin', ""I'm in love with you"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And don't you leave 'cause I know
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),All I need is on the other side of the door
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And I'll scream out the window
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I can't even look at you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I don't need you but I do, I do, I do"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I say, ""There's nothing you can say"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"To make this right again, I mean it, I mean it"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But what I mean is
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I said, ""Leave,"" but, baby, all I want is you"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Screamin', ""I'm in love with you"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And don't you leave 'cause I know
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),All I need is on the other side of the door
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),With your face and the beautiful eyes
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And the conversation with the little white lies
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And the faded picture of a beautiful night
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You carried me from your car up the stairs
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),After everything and that little black dress
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"After everything I must confess, I need you"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Today was a fairytale
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You were the prince
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I used to be a damsel in distress
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Today was a fairytale
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Today was a fairytale
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Today was a fairytale
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I wore a dress
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You wore a dark gray t-shirt
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Today was a fairytale
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Time slows down
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Whenever you're around
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Can you feel this magic in the air?
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It must have been the way you kissed me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Fell in love when I saw you standing there
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It must have been the way
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Today was a fairytale
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It must have been the way
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Today was a fairytale
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Today was a fairytale
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You've got a smile
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),That takes me to another planet
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Every move you make, everything you say is right"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Today was a fairytale
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Today was a fairytale
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),All that I can say
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Is now it's getting so much clearer
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Today was a fairytale
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Time slows down
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Whenever you're around, yeah"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But can you feel this magic in the air?
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It must have been the way you kissed me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Fell in love when I saw you standing there
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It must have been the way
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Today was a fairytale
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It must have been the way
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Today was a fairytale
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Time slows down
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Whenever you're around
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I can feel my heart
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It's beating in my chest
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Did you feel it?
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I can't put this down
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But can you feel this magic in the air?
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It must have been the way you kissed me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Fell in love when I saw you standing there
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It must have been the way
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But can you feel this magic in the air?
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It must have been the way you kissed me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Fell in love when I saw you standing there
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It must have been the way
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Today was a fairytale
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It must have been the way
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Today was a fairytale
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Oh, oh, yeah, oh-oh"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Today was a fairytale
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"They leave 'em muddy underneath, reminds me of you"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You know, you can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"But like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Held out, and held on"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"God knows, too long, and wasted time"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But no amount of freedom gets you clean
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I've still got you all over me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),The best and worst day of June
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Was the one that I met you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),With your hands in your pockets
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And your ""Don't you wish you had me?"" grin"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Well I did, so I smiled"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And I melted like a child
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Held out, and held on"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"God knows, too long, and wasted time"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But no amount of freedom gets you clean
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I've still got you all over me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I lived, and I learned"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And found out what it was to turn around
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And see that we
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Were never really meant to be
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"So I lied, and I cried"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And I watched a part of myself die
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I've still got you all over me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I've still got you all over me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Still got you all over me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Mr. ""Perfect face"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Mr. ""Here to stay"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Mr. ""Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Everything was right
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Mr. ""I've been waitin' for you all my life"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Mr. ""Every single day until the end, I will be by your side"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"But that was when I got to know Mr. ""Change of heart"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Mr. ""Leaves me all alone,"" I fall apart"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It takes everything in me just to get up each day
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But it's wonderful to see that you're okay
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Hello, Mr. ""Perfectly fine"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Mr. ""Always at the right place at the right time,"" baby"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Hello, Mr. ""Casually cruel"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Mr. ""Everything revolves around you"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And you're Mr. ""Perfectly fine"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Mr. ""Never told me why"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Mr. ""Never had to see me cry"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Mr. ""Insincere apology so he doesn't look like the bad guy"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),He goes about his day
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Forgets he ever even heard my name
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Well, I thought you might be different than the rest, I guess you're all the same"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),'Cause I hear he's got his arm 'round a brand-new girl
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I've been pickin' up my heart, he's been pickin' up her"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And I never got past what you put me through
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But it's wonderful to see that it never phased you
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Hello, Mr. ""Perfectly fine"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Mr. ""Always at the right place at the right time,"" baby"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Hello, Mr. ""Casually cruel"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Mr. ""Everything revolves around you"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And you're Mr. ""Perfectly fine"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),So dignified in your well-pressed suit
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"So strategized, all the eyes on you"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Sashay your way to your seat
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"It's the best seat, in the best room"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Oh, he's so smug, Mr. ""Always wins"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),So far above me in every sense
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),So far above feeling anything
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And it's really such a shame
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It's such a shame
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"'Cause I was Miss ""Here to stay"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Now I'm Miss ""Gonna be alright someday"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And someday maybe you'll miss me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"But by then, you'll be Mr. ""Too late"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Goodbye, Mr. ""Perfectly fine"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Mr. ""Always at the right place at the right time,"" baby"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Goodbye, Mr. ""Casually cruel"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Mr. ""Everything revolves around you"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I've been Miss Misery for the last time
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And you're Mr. ""Perfectly fine"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You're perfectly fine
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Mr. ""Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You said you'd never go away
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),We used to walk along the streets
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),When the porch lights were shining bright
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Before I had somewhere to be
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Back when we had all night and we were happy
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I do recall a good while back, we snuck into the circus"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And we were happy
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"When it was good, baby, it was good, baby"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),We showed 'em all up
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And we were happy
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),We used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),That's sorta how I feel right now
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And goodbye's so much harder 'cause we were happy
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"When it was good, baby, it was good, baby"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),We showed 'em all up
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And we were happy
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),We were happy
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Oh, I hate those voices telling me I'm not in love anymore"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),But they don't give me choices and that's what these tears are for
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),'Cause we were happy
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),We were happy
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"When it was good, baby, it was good, baby"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),We showed 'em all up
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And you were gonna marry me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And we were happy
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),We were happy
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Oh-oh-oh-oh
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),We were happy
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You said, ""I know"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"When I said, ""I need some time, need some space"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"To think about all of this"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You watched me go
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And I knew my
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Words were hard to hear
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And harder to ever take back
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And I said, ""When can I-I-I come back?"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And you said that's when
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),When I wake up in the morning
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"That's when, when it's sunny or storming"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Laughing, when I'm crying"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And that's when, I'll be waiting at the front gate"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"That's when, when I see your face"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I'll let you in, and baby, that's when"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Mm, mm"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I said, ""I know"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"When you said, ""I did you wrong"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Made mistakes
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And put you through all of this"" (through all of this)"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Then through the phone
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Came all your tears
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And I said, ""Leave those all in our past"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And you said, ""When can I-I-I come back?"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And I said, that's when"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),When I wake up in the morning
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"That's when, when it's sunny or storming"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Laughing, when I'm crying"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And that's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"That's when, when I see your face"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I'll let you in, and baby, that's when"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And you said, ""Honestly"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),When you were gone
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Did you ever think of me?"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And I said
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"""That's when, when I woke up in the morning"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"That's when, it was sunny or storming"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Laughing when I was crying
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"And that's when, you were waiting at the front gate"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"That's when, when I saw your face"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"You let me in, and baby, that's when"""
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"That's when, when I wake up in the morning (Yeah)"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"That's when, when it's sunny or storming"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"When I'm laughing, when I'm crying"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"(That when I miss you, that's when I want you)"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"That's when, when I see your face"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"That's when I love you, that's when"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Hey, I knew I'd run into you somewhere"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"It's been a while, I didn't mean to stare"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I heard she's nothin' like me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I'm sure she'll make you happy
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"But don't you, don't you"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Smile at me and ask me how I've been
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Don't you say you've
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Missed me if you don't want me again
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You don't know how much I feel I love you still
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"So why don't you, don't you?"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Ah, ah, ah, ah"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Ah, ah, ah"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Sometimes, I really wish that I could hate you"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I've tried, but that's just somethin' I can't do"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),My heart knows what the truth is
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I swore I wouldn't do this
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"But don't you, don't you"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Smile at me and ask me how I've been
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Don't you say you've
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Missed me if you don't want me again
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You don't know how much I feel I love you still
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"So why don't you, don't you?"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),So I walk outta here tonight
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Try to go on with my life
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And you can say we're still friends
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),(But I don't wanna pretend)
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),So if I see you again
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Don't you (Don't you), don't you"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Smile at me and ask me how I've been
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Don't you (Don't you) say you've
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Missed me if you don't want me again
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You don't (You don't) know how much I feel I love you still
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"So why don't you, don't you?"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Ah, ah, ah, ah"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Don't you (Ah, ah, ah)"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),It wasn't just like a movie
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"I'm drivin' away and I, I guess you could say"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),This is the last time I'll drive this way again
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"'Cause I, I still love you but I can't"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Bye bye baby
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And all I have is your sympathy
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Bye bye baby
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Bye bye baby
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),The picture frame is empty
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"On the dresser, vacant just like me"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I see your writing on the dash
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Then back to your hesitation
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I was so sure of everything
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Everything I thought we'd always have
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Guess I never doubted it
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Then the here and the now floods in
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Bye bye baby
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And all I have is your sympathy
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Bye bye baby
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And there's so much that I can't touch
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),You're all I want but it's not enough this time
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And all the pages are just slipping through my hands
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And I'm so scared of how this ends
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Bye bye baby
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And all I have is your sympathy
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Bye bye baby
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And all I have is your sympathy
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Oh, you took me home, I thought you were gonna keep me"
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Bye bye baby
Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Bye bye baby
Speak Now (Deluxe),"You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Left a small town and never looked back
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I say, ""Can you believe it?"""
Speak Now (Deluxe),As we're lying on the couch
Speak Now (Deluxe),"The moment, I could see it"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Yes, yes, I can see it now"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?"
Speak Now (Deluxe),You put your arm around me for the first time
Speak Now (Deluxe),You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
Speak Now (Deluxe),You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together"
Speak Now (Deluxe),And there's a drawer of my things at your place

Speak Now (Deluxe),Braced myself for the goodbye
Speak Now (Deluxe),'Cause that's all I've ever known
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Then, you took me by surprise"

Speak Now (Deluxe),"You said, ""I remember how we felt, sitting by the water"

Speak Now (Deluxe),And I can see it
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Yeah, yeah"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I can see it now (See it now)
Speak Now (Deluxe),The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
Speak Now (Deluxe),And I'm a house of cards
Speak Now (Deluxe),You're the kind of reckless
Speak Now (Deluxe),That should send me running
Speak Now (Deluxe),But I kinda know that I won't get far
Speak Now (Deluxe),And you stood there in front of me
Speak Now (Deluxe),Just close enough to touch
Speak Now (Deluxe),Close enough to hope you couldn't see
Speak Now (Deluxe),What I was thinking of
Speak Now (Deluxe),Drop everything now
Speak Now (Deluxe),Meet me in the pouring rain
Speak Now (Deluxe),Kiss me on the sidewalk
Speak Now (Deluxe),Take away the pain
Speak Now (Deluxe),'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
Speak Now (Deluxe),'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Speak Now (Deluxe),My mind forgets to remind me
Speak Now (Deluxe),You're a bad idea
Speak Now (Deluxe),You touch me once and it's really something
Speak Now (Deluxe),You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
Speak Now (Deluxe),I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
Speak Now (Deluxe),But with you I know it's no good
Speak Now (Deluxe),And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would
Speak Now (Deluxe),Drop everything now
Speak Now (Deluxe),Meet me in the pouring rain
Speak Now (Deluxe),Kiss me on the sidewalk
Speak Now (Deluxe),Take away the pain
Speak Now (Deluxe),'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
Speak Now (Deluxe),'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Speak Now (Deluxe),I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Speak Now (Deluxe),Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
Speak Now (Deluxe),It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
Speak Now (Deluxe),And lead me up the staircase
Speak Now (Deluxe),Won't you whisper soft and slow?
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Drop everything now
Speak Now (Deluxe),Meet me in the pouring rain
Speak Now (Deluxe),Kiss me on the sidewalk
Speak Now (Deluxe),Take away the pain
Speak Now (Deluxe),'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
Speak Now (Deluxe),'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Speak Now (Deluxe),And the sparks fly
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Oh, baby, smile"
Speak Now (Deluxe),And the sparks fly
Speak Now (Deluxe),I'm so glad you made time to see me
Speak Now (Deluxe),"How's life? Tell me, how's your family?"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I haven't seen them in a while
Speak Now (Deluxe),"You've been good, busier than ever"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"We small talk, work and the weather"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Your guard is up and I know why
Speak Now (Deluxe),Because the last time you saw me
Speak Now (Deluxe),Is still burned in the back of your mind
Speak Now (Deluxe),"You gave me roses, and I left them there to die"
Speak Now (Deluxe),So this is me swallowing my pride
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night"
Speak Now (Deluxe),And I go back to December all the time
Speak Now (Deluxe),It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Speak Now (Deluxe),Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I go back to December all the time
Speak Now (Deluxe),"These days, I haven't been sleeping"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Staying up, playing back myself leaving"
Speak Now (Deluxe),When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Speak Now (Deluxe),"And I think about summer, all the beautiful times"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Speak Now (Deluxe),Realized I loved you in the fall
Speak Now (Deluxe),And then the cold came
Speak Now (Deluxe),The dark days when fear crept into my mind
Speak Now (Deluxe),"You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye"
Speak Now (Deluxe),So this is me swallowing my pride
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night"
Speak Now (Deluxe),And I go back to December all the time
Speak Now (Deluxe),It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Speak Now (Deluxe),Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I go back to December all the time
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"So good to me, so right"
Speak Now (Deluxe),And how you held me in your arms that September night
Speak Now (Deluxe),The first time you ever saw me cry
Speak Now (Deluxe),Maybe this is wishful thinking
Speak Now (Deluxe),Probably mindless dreaming
Speak Now (Deluxe),"But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"So if the chain is on your door, I understand"
Speak Now (Deluxe),But this is me swallowing my pride
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night"
Speak Now (Deluxe),And I go back to December
Speak Now (Deluxe),It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Speak Now (Deluxe),Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I go back to December all the time
Speak Now (Deluxe),All the time
Speak Now (Deluxe),I am not the kind of girl
Speak Now (Deluxe),Who should be rudely barging in
Speak Now (Deluxe),On a white veil occasion
Speak Now (Deluxe),But you are not the kind of boy
Speak Now (Deluxe),Who should be marrying the wrong girl
Speak Now (Deluxe),I sneak in and see your friends
Speak Now (Deluxe),And her snotty little family
Speak Now (Deluxe),All dressed in pastel
Speak Now (Deluxe),And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Speak Now (Deluxe),Somewhere back inside a room
Speak Now (Deluxe),Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
Speak Now (Deluxe),This is surely not
Speak Now (Deluxe),What you thought it would be
Speak Now (Deluxe),I lose myself in a daydream
Speak Now (Deluxe),Where I stand and say
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Don't say yes, run away now"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I'll meet you when you're out
Speak Now (Deluxe),Of the church at the back door
Speak Now (Deluxe),Don't wait or say a single vow
Speak Now (Deluxe),You need to hear me out
Speak Now (Deluxe),"And they said, ""speak now"""
Speak Now (Deluxe),Fond gestures are exchanged
Speak Now (Deluxe),And the organ starts to play
Speak Now (Deluxe),A song that sounds like a death march
Speak Now (Deluxe),And I am hiding in the curtains
Speak Now (Deluxe),It seems that I was uninvited
Speak Now (Deluxe),By your lovely bride-to-be
Speak Now (Deluxe),She floats down the aisle
Speak Now (Deluxe),Like a pageant queen
Speak Now (Deluxe),But I know you wish it was me
Speak Now (Deluxe),You wish it was me (Don't you)
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Don't say yes, run away now"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I'll meet you when you're out
Speak Now (Deluxe),Of the church at the back door
Speak Now (Deluxe),Don't wait or say a single vow
Speak Now (Deluxe),You need to hear me out
Speak Now (Deluxe),"And they said, ""speak now"""
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Don't say yes, run away now"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I'll meet you when you're out
Speak Now (Deluxe),Of the church at the back door
Speak Now (Deluxe),Don't wait or say a single vow
Speak Now (Deluxe),Your time is running out
Speak Now (Deluxe),"And they said, ""speak now"""
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Ooh, la-da-da-da, oh"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Ooh, ooh"
Speak Now (Deluxe),(Say a single vow)
Speak Now (Deluxe),I hear the preacher say
Speak Now (Deluxe),"""Speak now or forever hold your peace"""
Speak Now (Deluxe),"There's the silence, there's my last chance"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I stand up with shaking hands, all eyes on me"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Horrified looks from everyone in the room
Speak Now (Deluxe),But I'm only looking at you
Speak Now (Deluxe),I am not the kind of girl
Speak Now (Deluxe),Who should be rudely barging in
Speak Now (Deluxe),On a white veil occasion
Speak Now (Deluxe),But you are not the kind of boy
Speak Now (Deluxe),Who should be marrying the wrong girl
Speak Now (Deluxe),(Hehe!)
Speak Now (Deluxe),"So don't say yes, run away now"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I'll meet you when you're out
Speak Now (Deluxe),Of the church at the back door
Speak Now (Deluxe),Don't wait or say a single vow
Speak Now (Deluxe),You need to hear me out
Speak Now (Deluxe),"And they said, ""speak now"""
Speak Now (Deluxe),And you say
Speak Now (Deluxe),"""Let's run away now"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I'll meet you when
Speak Now (Deluxe),I'm out of my tux at the back door
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Baby, I didn't say my vows"
Speak Now (Deluxe),So glad you were around when they said
Speak Now (Deluxe),"'Speak now'"""
Speak Now (Deluxe),Long were the nights when
Speak Now (Deluxe),My days once revolved around you
Speak Now (Deluxe),Counting my footsteps
Speak Now (Deluxe),Praying the floor won't fall through... again
Speak Now (Deluxe),My mother accused me of losing my mind
Speak Now (Deluxe),But I swore I was fine
Speak Now (Deluxe),You paint me a blue sky
Speak Now (Deluxe),Then go back and turn it to rain
Speak Now (Deluxe),And I lived in your chess game
Speak Now (Deluxe),But you changed the rules everyday
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Well, I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
Speak Now (Deluxe),The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Speak Now (Deluxe),I shoulda known
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Well, maybe it's me"
Speak Now (Deluxe),And my blind optimism to blame
Speak Now (Deluxe),Or maybe it's you and your sick need
Speak Now (Deluxe),To give love and take it away
Speak Now (Deluxe),And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Speak Now (Deluxe),Who don't understand
Speak Now (Deluxe),And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
Speak Now (Deluxe),"""Run as fast as you can"""
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
Speak Now (Deluxe),The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Don't you think nineteen's too young
Speak Now (Deluxe),"To be played by your dark, twisted games"
Speak Now (Deluxe),When I loved you so?
Speak Now (Deluxe),I shoulda known
Speak Now (Deluxe),You are an expert at sorry
Speak Now (Deluxe),And keeping lines blurry
Speak Now (Deluxe),Never impressed by me acing your tests
Speak Now (Deluxe),All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
Speak Now (Deluxe),'Cause you burned them out
Speak Now (Deluxe),But I took your matches
Speak Now (Deluxe),Before fire could catch me
Speak Now (Deluxe),So don't look now
Speak Now (Deluxe),I'm shining like fireworks
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Over your sad empty town, yeah"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
Speak Now (Deluxe),The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Speak Now (Deluxe),I see it all now that you're gone
Speak Now (Deluxe),Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
Speak Now (Deluxe),The girl in the dress wrote you a song
Speak Now (Deluxe),You shoulda known
Speak Now (Deluxe),You shoulda known
Speak Now (Deluxe),Don't you think I was too young?
Speak Now (Deluxe),You shoulda known
Speak Now (Deluxe),"You, with your words like knives"
Speak Now (Deluxe),And swords and weapons that you use against me
Speak Now (Deluxe),You have knocked me off my feet again
Speak Now (Deluxe),Got me feeling like I'm nothing
Speak Now (Deluxe),"You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Calling me out when I'm wounded
Speak Now (Deluxe),"You, picking on the weaker man"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Well, you can take me down"
Speak Now (Deluxe),With just one single blow
Speak Now (Deluxe),But you don't know what you don't know
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Someday, I'll be living in a big old city"
Speak Now (Deluxe),And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me"
Speak Now (Deluxe),And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Speak Now (Deluxe),Why you gotta be so mean?
Speak Now (Deluxe),"You, with your switching sides"
Speak Now (Deluxe),And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
Speak Now (Deluxe),You have pointed out my flaws again
Speak Now (Deluxe),As if I don't already see them
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I walk with my head down, trying to block you out"
Speak Now (Deluxe),'Cause I'll never impress you
Speak Now (Deluxe),I just wanna feel okay again
Speak Now (Deluxe),I bet you got pushed around
Speak Now (Deluxe),Somebody made you cold
Speak Now (Deluxe),But the cycle ends right now
Speak Now (Deluxe),'Cause you can't lead me down that road
Speak Now (Deluxe),And you don't know what you don't know
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Someday, I'll be living in a big old city"
Speak Now (Deluxe),And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me"
Speak Now (Deluxe),And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Speak Now (Deluxe),Why you gotta be so mean?
Speak Now (Deluxe),And I can see you years from now in a bar
Speak Now (Deluxe),Talking over a football game
Speak Now (Deluxe),With that same big loud opinion
Speak Now (Deluxe),But nobody's listening
Speak Now (Deluxe),Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Speak Now (Deluxe),Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
Speak Now (Deluxe),But all you are is mean
Speak Now (Deluxe),All you are is mean
Speak Now (Deluxe),"And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"But someday, I'll be living in a big old city"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me"
Speak Now (Deluxe),And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Speak Now (Deluxe),Why you gotta be so mean?
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Someday, I'll be living in a big old city"
Speak Now (Deluxe),(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Speak Now (Deluxe),And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Speak Now (Deluxe),(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me"
Speak Now (Deluxe),(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Speak Now (Deluxe),And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Speak Now (Deluxe),Why you gotta be so mean?
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I used to think one day, we'd tell the story of us"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"How we met, and the sparks flew instantly"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"And people would say, they're the lucky ones"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Speak Now (Deluxe),Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
Speak Now (Deluxe),"'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Oh, a simple complication"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Miscommunications lead to fallout
Speak Now (Deluxe),So many things that I wish you knew
Speak Now (Deluxe),"So many walls up, I can't break through"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
Speak Now (Deluxe),And we're not speaking
Speak Now (Deluxe),And I'm dying to know
Speak Now (Deluxe),Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Yeah, I don't know what to say"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Since the twist of fate when it all broke down
Speak Now (Deluxe),And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Speak Now (Deluxe),Next chapter
Speak Now (Deluxe),How'd we end up this way?
Speak Now (Deluxe),See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
Speak Now (Deluxe),And you're doing your best to avoid me
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I'm starting to think one day, I'll tell the story of us"
Speak Now (Deluxe),How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
Speak Now (Deluxe),But you held your pride like you should've held me
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Oh, I'm scared to see the ending"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Why are we pretending this is nothing?
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I've never heard silence quite this loud
Speak Now (Deluxe),Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
Speak Now (Deluxe),And we're not speaking
Speak Now (Deluxe),And I'm dying to know
Speak Now (Deluxe),Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Yeah, and I don't know what to say"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Since the twist of fate, when it all broke down"
Speak Now (Deluxe),And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Speak Now (Deluxe),This is looking like a contest
Speak Now (Deluxe),Of who can act like they care less
Speak Now (Deluxe),But I liked it better when you were on my side
Speak Now (Deluxe),The battle's in your hands now
Speak Now (Deluxe),But I would lay my armor down
Speak Now (Deluxe),If you say you'd rather love than fight
Speak Now (Deluxe),So many things that you wish I knew
Speak Now (Deluxe),But the story of us might be ending soon
Speak Now (Deluxe),Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
Speak Now (Deluxe),And we're not speaking
Speak Now (Deluxe),And I'm dying to know
Speak Now (Deluxe),Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Yeah, and I don't know what to say"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Since the twist of fate, when it all broke down"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now"
Speak Now (Deluxe),And we're not speaking
Speak Now (Deluxe),And I'm dying to know
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
Speak Now (Deluxe),'Cause we're going down
Speak Now (Deluxe),And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Speak Now (Deluxe),The End
Speak Now (Deluxe),Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
Speak Now (Deluxe),And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Speak Now (Deluxe),Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
Speak Now (Deluxe),"So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I'd give all I have, honey"
Speak Now (Deluxe),If you could stay like that
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Oh darling, don't you ever grow up"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Oh darling, don't you ever grow up"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart"
Speak Now (Deluxe),And no one will desert you
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Just try to never grow up, never grow up"
Speak Now (Deluxe),You're in the car on the way to the movies
Speak Now (Deluxe),And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
Speak Now (Deluxe),"At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do"
Speak Now (Deluxe),And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
Speak Now (Deluxe),But don't make her drop you off around the block
Speak Now (Deluxe),Remember that she's getting older too
Speak Now (Deluxe),And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Oh darling, don't you ever grow up"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Oh darling, don't you ever grow up"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"And even though you want to, just try to never grow up"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Speak Now (Deluxe),Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Remember the footsteps, remember the words said"
Speak Now (Deluxe),And all your little brother's favorite songs
Speak Now (Deluxe),I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
Speak Now (Deluxe),So here I am in my new apartment
Speak Now (Deluxe),"In a big city, they just dropped me off"
Speak Now (Deluxe),It's so much colder than I thought it would be
Speak Now (Deluxe),So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on
Speak Now (Deluxe),Wish I'd never grown up
Speak Now (Deluxe),I wish I'd never grown up
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Oh, I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I could still be little
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Oh, I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up"
Speak Now (Deluxe),It could still be simple
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Oh darling, don't you ever grow up"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Oh darling, don't you ever grow up"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Won't let nobody hurt you
Speak Now (Deluxe),Won't let no one break your heart
Speak Now (Deluxe),"And even though you want to, please try to never grow up"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Oh, don't you ever grow up"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Oh, never grow up, just never grow up"
Speak Now (Deluxe),There I was again tonight
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Forcing laughter, faking smiles"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Same old tired, lonely place"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Vanished when I saw your face
Speak Now (Deluxe),"All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?"""
Speak Now (Deluxe),'Cross the room your silhouette
Speak Now (Deluxe),Starts to make its way to me
Speak Now (Deluxe),The playful conversation starts
Speak Now (Deluxe),Counter all your quick remarks
Speak Now (Deluxe),Like passing notes in secrecy
Speak Now (Deluxe),And it was enchanting to meet you
Speak Now (Deluxe),"All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you"
Speak Now (Deluxe),This night is sparkling
Speak Now (Deluxe),Don't you let it go
Speak Now (Deluxe),I'm wonderstruck
Speak Now (Deluxe),Blushing all the way home
Speak Now (Deluxe),I'll spend forever
Speak Now (Deluxe),Wondering if you knew
Speak Now (Deluxe),I was enchanted to meet you
Speak Now (Deluxe),Nardo Wick 'Who Want Smoke??' (Live Performance) | Open Mic
Speak Now (Deluxe),Nardo Wick 'Who Want Smoke??' (Live Performance) | Open Mic
Speak Now (Deluxe),The lingering question kept me up
Speak Now (Deluxe),"2AM, who do you love?"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
Speak Now (Deluxe),And now I'm pacing back and forth
Speak Now (Deluxe),Wishing you were at my door
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I'd open up and you would say, ""Hey"""
Speak Now (Deluxe),It was enchanting to meet you
Speak Now (Deluxe),All I know is I was enchanted to meet you
Speak Now (Deluxe),This night is sparkling
Speak Now (Deluxe),Don't you let it go
Speak Now (Deluxe),I'm wonderstruck
Speak Now (Deluxe),Blushing all the way home
Speak Now (Deluxe),I'll spend forever
Speak Now (Deluxe),Wondering if you knew
Speak Now (Deluxe),This night is flawless
Speak Now (Deluxe),Don't you let it go
Speak Now (Deluxe),I'm wonderstruck
Speak Now (Deluxe),Dancing around all alone
Speak Now (Deluxe),I'll spend forever
Speak Now (Deluxe),Wondering if you knew
Speak Now (Deluxe),I was enchanted to meet you
Speak Now (Deluxe),This is me praying that
Speak Now (Deluxe),This was the very first page
Speak Now (Deluxe),Not where the storyline ends
Speak Now (Deluxe),My thoughts will echo your name
Speak Now (Deluxe),Until I see you again
Speak Now (Deluxe),These are the words I held back
Speak Now (Deluxe),As I was leaving too soon
Speak Now (Deluxe),I was enchanted to meet you
Speak Now (Deluxe),Please don't be in love
Speak Now (Deluxe),With someone else
Speak Now (Deluxe),Please don't have somebody
Speak Now (Deluxe),Waiting on you
Speak Now (Deluxe),Please don't be in love (Ooh)
Speak Now (Deluxe),With someone else
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Please don't have somebody (Ooh, hey)"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Waiting on you
Speak Now (Deluxe),This night is sparkling
Speak Now (Deluxe),Don't you let it go
Speak Now (Deluxe),I'm wonderstruck
Speak Now (Deluxe),Blushing all the way home
Speak Now (Deluxe),I'll spend forever
Speak Now (Deluxe),Wondering if you knew
Speak Now (Deluxe),This night is flawless (Please don't be in love with someone else)
Speak Now (Deluxe),Don't you let it go
Speak Now (Deluxe),I'm wonderstruck (Please don't have somebody waiting on you)
Speak Now (Deluxe),Dancing around all alone
Speak Now (Deluxe),I'll spend forever (Please don't be in love with someone else)
Speak Now (Deluxe),Wondering if you knew
Speak Now (Deluxe),I was enchanted to meet you
Speak Now (Deluxe),Please don't be in love
Speak Now (Deluxe),With someone else
Speak Now (Deluxe),Please don't have somebody
Speak Now (Deluxe),Waiting on you
Speak Now (Deluxe),Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Ha, time for a little revenge"
Speak Now (Deluxe),The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"She came along, got him alone and let's hear the applause"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"She took him faster than you can say ""Sabotage"""
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I underestimated just who I was dealing with
Speak Now (Deluxe),She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
Speak Now (Deluxe),She underestimated just who she was stealing from
Speak Now (Deluxe),She's not a saint and she's not what you think
Speak Now (Deluxe),"She's an actress, whoa"
Speak Now (Deluxe),She's better known for the things that she does
Speak Now (Deluxe),"On the mattress, whoa"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
Speak Now (Deluxe),On the playground won't make you many friends
Speak Now (Deluxe),"She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha"
Speak Now (Deluxe),She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
Speak Now (Deluxe),She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
Speak Now (Deluxe),I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
Speak Now (Deluxe),And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
Speak Now (Deluxe),But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Speak Now (Deluxe),Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me"
Speak Now (Deluxe),But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
Speak Now (Deluxe),(Think about what you did)
Speak Now (Deluxe),She's not a saint and she's not what you think
Speak Now (Deluxe),"She's an actress, whoa"
Speak Now (Deluxe),She's better known for the things that she does
Speak Now (Deluxe),"On the mattress, whoa"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
Speak Now (Deluxe),On the playground won't make you many friends
Speak Now (Deluxe),"She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"You might have him, but haven't you heard?"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"You might have him, but I always get the last word"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Whoa, whoa-ah-oh"
Speak Now (Deluxe),She's not a saint and she's not what you think
Speak Now (Deluxe),"She's an actress, whoa (She deserved it)"
Speak Now (Deluxe),She's better known for the things that she does
Speak Now (Deluxe),"On the mattress, whoa"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
Speak Now (Deluxe),On the playground won't make you many friends
Speak Now (Deluxe),"She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
Speak Now (Deluxe),"'Cause I don't think you do, oh (No, no, no, no)"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? (No)
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I don't think you do, I don't think you do"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Let's hear the applause (Come on, come on)"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Come on, show me how much better you are"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"(So much better, yeah?)"
Speak Now (Deluxe),See you deserve some applause
Speak Now (Deluxe),'Cause you're so much better
Speak Now (Deluxe),"She took him faster than you could say ""Sabotage"""
Speak Now (Deluxe),I guess you really did it this time
Speak Now (Deluxe),Left yourself in your war path
Speak Now (Deluxe),Lost your balance on a tightrope
Speak Now (Deluxe),Lost your mind trying to get it back
Speak Now (Deluxe),Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Speak Now (Deluxe),Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Speak Now (Deluxe),Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
Speak Now (Deluxe),And everybody believed in you?
Speak Now (Deluxe),"It's alright, just wait and see"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Your string of lights is still bright to me
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Oh, who you are is not where you've been"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"You're still an innocent, you're still an innocent"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Did some things you can't speak of
Speak Now (Deluxe),But at night you live it all again
Speak Now (Deluxe),You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
Speak Now (Deluxe),If only you had seen what you know now then
Speak Now (Deluxe),Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
Speak Now (Deluxe),When everything out of reach
Speak Now (Deluxe),Someone bigger brought down to you
Speak Now (Deluxe),Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
Speak Now (Deluxe),Before the monsters caught up to you?
Speak Now (Deluxe),"It's alright, just wait and see"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Your string of lights is still bright to me
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Oh, who you are is not where you've been"
Speak Now (Deluxe),You're still an innocent
Speak Now (Deluxe),"It's okay, life is a tough crowd"
Speak Now (Deluxe),32 and still growing up now
Speak Now (Deluxe),Who you are is not what you did
Speak Now (Deluxe),You're still an innocent
Speak Now (Deluxe),Time turns flames to embers
Speak Now (Deluxe),You'll have new Septembers
Speak Now (Deluxe),Every one of us has messed up too
Speak Now (Deluxe),Lives change like the weather
Speak Now (Deluxe),I hope you remember
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Today is never too late to be brand new, oh"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"It's alright, just wait and see"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Your string of lights is still bright to me
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Oh, who you are is not where you've been"
Speak Now (Deluxe),You're still an innocent
Speak Now (Deluxe),"It's okay, life is a tough crowd"
Speak Now (Deluxe),32 and still growing up now
Speak Now (Deluxe),Who you are is not what you did
Speak Now (Deluxe),"You're still an innocent, you're still an innocent"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Lost your balance on a tightrope, oh"
Speak Now (Deluxe),It's never too late to get it back
Speak Now (Deluxe),You and I walk a fragile line
Speak Now (Deluxe),I have known it all this time
Speak Now (Deluxe),But I never thought I'd live to see it break
Speak Now (Deluxe),It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
Speak Now (Deluxe),And I can't trust anything now
Speak Now (Deluxe),And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Whoa, holding my breath"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Won't lose you again
Speak Now (Deluxe),Something's made your eyes go cold
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Come on, come on, don't leave me like this"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I thought I had you figured out
Speak Now (Deluxe),Something's gone terribly wrong
Speak Now (Deluxe),You're all I wanted
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Come on, come on, don't leave me like this"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I thought I had you figured out
Speak Now (Deluxe),Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Can't turn back now, I'm haunted"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Stood there and watched you walk away
Speak Now (Deluxe),From everything we had
Speak Now (Deluxe),But I still mean every word I said to you
Speak Now (Deluxe),He will try to take away my pain
Speak Now (Deluxe),And he just might make me smile
Speak Now (Deluxe),"But the whole time, I'm wishing it was you instead"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Oh, holding my breath"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Won't see you again
Speak Now (Deluxe),Something keeps me holding onto nothing
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Come on, come on, don't leave me like this"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I thought I had you figured out
Speak Now (Deluxe),Something's gone terribly wrong
Speak Now (Deluxe),You're all I wanted
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Come on, come on, don't leave me like this"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I thought I had you figured out
Speak Now (Deluxe),Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Can't turn back now, I'm haunted"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I know
Speak Now (Deluxe),I know
Speak Now (Deluxe),I just know
Speak Now (Deluxe),"You're not gone, you can't be gone, no"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Come on, come on, don't leave me like this"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I thought I had you figured out
Speak Now (Deluxe),Something's gone terribly wrong
Speak Now (Deluxe),Won't finish what you started
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Come on, come on, don't leave me like this"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I thought I had you figured out
Speak Now (Deluxe),Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Can't go back, I'm haunted"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)"
Speak Now (Deluxe),You and I walk a fragile line
Speak Now (Deluxe),I have known it all this time
Speak Now (Deluxe),Never ever thought I'd see it break
Speak Now (Deluxe),Never thought I'd see it
Speak Now (Deluxe),I still remember the look on your face
Speak Now (Deluxe),Lit through the darkness at 1:58
Speak Now (Deluxe),The words that you whispered
Speak Now (Deluxe),For just us to know
Speak Now (Deluxe),You told me you loved me
Speak Now (Deluxe),So why did you go away?
Speak Now (Deluxe),Away
Speak Now (Deluxe),I do recall now the smell of the rain
Speak Now (Deluxe),Fresh on the pavement
Speak Now (Deluxe),I ran off the plane
Speak Now (Deluxe),That July 9th
Speak Now (Deluxe),The beat of your heart
Speak Now (Deluxe),It jumps through your shirt
Speak Now (Deluxe),I can still feel your arms
Speak Now (Deluxe),But now I'll go sit on the floor
Speak Now (Deluxe),Wearing your clothes
Speak Now (Deluxe),All that I know is
Speak Now (Deluxe),I don't know how to be something you miss
Speak Now (Deluxe),I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Speak Now (Deluxe),Never imagined we'd end like this
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Your name, forever the name on my lips"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I do remember the swing of your step
Speak Now (Deluxe),"The life of the party, you're showing off again"
Speak Now (Deluxe),And I roll my eyes and then
Speak Now (Deluxe),You pull me in
Speak Now (Deluxe),I'm not much for dancing
Speak Now (Deluxe),But for you I did
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Because I love your handshake, meeting my father"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
Speak Now (Deluxe),How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
Speak Now (Deluxe),There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions
Speak Now (Deluxe),And I'll go sit on the floor
Speak Now (Deluxe),Wearing your clothes
Speak Now (Deluxe),All that I know is
Speak Now (Deluxe),I don't know how to be something you miss
Speak Now (Deluxe),I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Speak Now (Deluxe),I never imagined we'd end like this
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Your name, forever the name on my lips, ooh"
Speak Now (Deluxe),So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
Speak Now (Deluxe),And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
Speak Now (Deluxe),And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Speak Now (Deluxe),Hope it's nice where you are
Speak Now (Deluxe),And I hope the sun shines
Speak Now (Deluxe),And it's a beautiful day
Speak Now (Deluxe),And something reminds you
Speak Now (Deluxe),You wish you had stayed
Speak Now (Deluxe),You can plan for a change in weather and time
Speak Now (Deluxe),But I never planned on you changing your mind
Speak Now (Deluxe),So I'll go sit on the floor
Speak Now (Deluxe),Wearing your clothes
Speak Now (Deluxe),All that I know is
Speak Now (Deluxe),I don't know how to be something you miss
Speak Now (Deluxe),I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Speak Now (Deluxe),Never imagined we'd end like this
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Your name, forever the name on my lips"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Just like our last kiss
Speak Now (Deluxe),Forever the name on my lips
Speak Now (Deluxe),Forever the name on my lips
Speak Now (Deluxe),Just like our last
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I said, remember this moment, in the back of my mind"
Speak Now (Deluxe),The time we stood with our shaking hands
Speak Now (Deluxe),The crowds in stands went wild
Speak Now (Deluxe),We were the kings and the queens
Speak Now (Deluxe),And they read off our names
Speak Now (Deluxe),The night you danced like you knew our lives
Speak Now (Deluxe),Would never be the same
Speak Now (Deluxe),You held your head like a hero
Speak Now (Deluxe),On a history book page
Speak Now (Deluxe),It was the end of a decade
Speak Now (Deluxe),But the start of an age
Speak Now (Deluxe),Long live the walls we crashed through
Speak Now (Deluxe),All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I was screaming, long live all the magic we made"
Speak Now (Deluxe),And bring on all the pretenders
Speak Now (Deluxe),"One day, we will be remembered"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I said, remember this feeling"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I passed the pictures around
Speak Now (Deluxe),Of all the years that we stood there
Speak Now (Deluxe),On the side-lines wishing for right now
Speak Now (Deluxe),We are the kings and the queens
Speak Now (Deluxe),You traded your baseball cap for a crown
Speak Now (Deluxe),When they gave us our trophies
Speak Now (Deluxe),And we held them up for our town
Speak Now (Deluxe),And the cynics were outraged
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Screaming, ""This is absurd"""
Speak Now (Deluxe),"'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves"
Speak Now (Deluxe),In ripped up jeans got to rule the world
Speak Now (Deluxe),Long live the walls we crashed through
Speak Now (Deluxe),All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I was screaming, long live all the magic we made"
Speak Now (Deluxe),And bring on all the pretenders
Speak Now (Deluxe),I'm not afraid
Speak Now (Deluxe),Long live all the mountains we moved
Speak Now (Deluxe),I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I was screaming, long live that look on your face"
Speak Now (Deluxe),And bring on all the pretenders
Speak Now (Deluxe),"One day, we will be remembered"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Hold on to spinning around
Speak Now (Deluxe),Confetti falls to the ground
Speak Now (Deluxe),May these memories break our fall
Speak Now (Deluxe),Will you take a moment?
Speak Now (Deluxe),Promise me this
Speak Now (Deluxe),That you'll stand by me forever
Speak Now (Deluxe),"But if, God forbid, fate should step in"
Speak Now (Deluxe),And force us into a goodbye
Speak Now (Deluxe),If you have children some day
Speak Now (Deluxe),When they point to the pictures
Speak Now (Deluxe),Please tell them my name
Speak Now (Deluxe),Tell them how the crowds went wild
Speak Now (Deluxe),Tell them how I hope they shine
Speak Now (Deluxe),Long live the walls we crashed through
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I had the time of my life, with you"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Long, long live the walls we crashed through"
Speak Now (Deluxe),All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I was screaming, long live all the magic we made"
Speak Now (Deluxe),And bring on all the pretenders
Speak Now (Deluxe),I'm not afraid
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Singing, long live all the mountains we moved"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
Speak Now (Deluxe),"And long, long live that look on your face"
Speak Now (Deluxe),And bring on all the pretenders
Speak Now (Deluxe),"One day, we will be remembered"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Elevator buttons and morning air
Speak Now (Deluxe),Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
Speak Now (Deluxe),"If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"But right now, my time is theirs"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
Speak Now (Deluxe),They'll judge it like they know about me and you
Speak Now (Deluxe),And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
Speak Now (Deluxe),"The jury's out, but my choice is you"
Speak Now (Deluxe),So don't you worry your pretty little mind
Speak Now (Deluxe),People throw rocks at things that shine
Speak Now (Deluxe),And life makes love look hard
Speak Now (Deluxe),"The stakes are high, the water's rough"
Speak Now (Deluxe),But this love is ours
Speak Now (Deluxe),You never know what people have up their sleeves
Speak Now (Deluxe),Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Speak Now (Deluxe),Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
Speak Now (Deluxe),"But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine"
Speak Now (Deluxe),And you'll say
Speak Now (Deluxe),Don't you worry your pretty little mind
Speak Now (Deluxe),People throw rocks at things that shine
Speak Now (Deluxe),And life makes love look hard
Speak Now (Deluxe),"The stakes are high, the water's rough"
Speak Now (Deluxe),But this love is ours
Speak Now (Deluxe),And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
Speak Now (Deluxe),"And your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong"
Speak Now (Deluxe),And I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
Speak Now (Deluxe),With this song for you
Speak Now (Deluxe),'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
Speak Now (Deluxe),And I love the riddles that you speak
Speak Now (Deluxe),And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Speak Now (Deluxe),Will be ignored
Speak Now (Deluxe),'Cause my heart is yours
Speak Now (Deluxe),So don't you worry your pretty little mind
Speak Now (Deluxe),People throw rocks at things that shine
Speak Now (Deluxe),And life makes love look hard
Speak Now (Deluxe),Don't you worry your pretty little mind
Speak Now (Deluxe),People throw rocks at things that shine
Speak Now (Deluxe),But they can't take what's ours
Speak Now (Deluxe),They can't take what's ours
Speak Now (Deluxe),"The stakes are high, the water's rough"
Speak Now (Deluxe),But this love is ours
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Last night, I heard my own heart beating"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Speak Now (Deluxe),Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Speak Now (Deluxe),Even though I know you're not there
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I was playing back a thousand memories, baby"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Thinkin' 'bout everything we've been through
Speak Now (Deluxe),Maybe I've been going back too much lately
Speak Now (Deluxe),When time stood still and I had you
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Come back, come back, come back to me like"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"You would, you would if this was a movie"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Stand in the rain outside till I came out
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Come back, come back, come back to me like"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"You could, you could if you just said you're sorry"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I know that we could work it out somehow
Speak Now (Deluxe),But if this was a movie you'd be here by now
Speak Now (Deluxe),I know people change and these things happen
Speak Now (Deluxe),But I remember how it was back then
Speak Now (Deluxe),Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing
Speak Now (Deluxe),'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Flashback to the night when you said to me
Speak Now (Deluxe),"""Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you"""
Speak Now (Deluxe),Not before I knew how much I had to lose
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Come back, come back, come back to me like"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"You would, you would if this was a movie"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Stand in the rain outside till I came out
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Come back, come back, come back to me like"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"You could, you could if you just said you're sorry"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I know that we could work it out somehow
Speak Now (Deluxe),But if this was a movie you'd be here by now
Speak Now (Deluxe),"If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I've been waiting for you every day since you've been gone
Speak Now (Deluxe),I just want it back the way it was before
Speak Now (Deluxe),And I just want to see you back at my front door
Speak Now (Deluxe),"And I say, ""Come back, come back, come back to me like"
Speak Now (Deluxe),You would before you said it's not that easy
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Before the fight, before I locked you out"""
Speak Now (Deluxe),But I take it all back now
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Come back, come back, come back to me like"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"You would, you would if this was a movie"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Stand in the rain outside till I came out
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Come back, come back, come back to me like"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"You could, you could if you just said you're sorry"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I know that we could work it out somehow
Speak Now (Deluxe),But if this was a movie you'd be here by now
Speak Now (Deluxe),You'd be here by now
Speak Now (Deluxe),It's not the kind of ending you want to see now
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Baby, what about the ending?"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Oh, I thought you'd be here by now"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Thought you'd be here by now
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Tall, dark, and superman"
Speak Now (Deluxe),He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
Speak Now (Deluxe),To save the world or go to work
Speak Now (Deluxe),It's the same thing to me
Speak Now (Deluxe),"He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I hang on every word you say, yay"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"And you smile and say, ""How are you?”"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I say, ""Just fine"""
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I always forget to tell you, I love you"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I love you forever
Speak Now (Deluxe),I watch superman fly away
Speak Now (Deluxe),You've got a busy day today
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Go save the world, I'll be around"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I watch superman fly away
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Come back, I'll be with you someday"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I'll be right here on the ground
Speak Now (Deluxe),When you come back down
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Tall, dark and beautiful"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"He's complicated, he's irrational"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
Speak Now (Deluxe),He's not all bad like his reputation
Speak Now (Deluxe),And I can't hear one single word they say
Speak Now (Deluxe),"And you'll leave, got places to be and I'll be okay"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I always forget to tell you I love you
Speak Now (Deluxe),I loved you from the very first day
Speak Now (Deluxe),I watch superman fly away
Speak Now (Deluxe),You've got a busy day today
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Go save the world, I'll be around"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I watch superman fly away
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Come back, I'll be with you someday"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I'll be right here on the ground
Speak Now (Deluxe),When you come back down
Speak Now (Deluxe),And I watch you fly around the world
Speak Now (Deluxe),And I hope you don't save some other girl
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Don't forget, don't forget about me"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I'm far away, but I never let you go"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I'm love-struck and looking out the window
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Right here, wishing the flowers were from you"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Wishing the card was from you
Speak Now (Deluxe),Wishing the call was from you
Speak Now (Deluxe),'Cause I loved you from the very first day
Speak Now (Deluxe),I watch superman fly away
Speak Now (Deluxe),You've got a busy day today
Speak Now (Deluxe),"Go save the world, I'll be around"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Forever and ever here
Speak Now (Deluxe),I watch superman fly away
Speak Now (Deluxe),"I swear, I'll be with you someday"
Speak Now (Deluxe),I'll be right here on the ground
Speak Now (Deluxe),When you come back down
Speak Now (Deluxe),"La, la, la, la, la, la"
Speak Now (Deluxe),"La, la, la, la, la, la"
Speak Now (Deluxe),When you come back down
Red (Deluxe Edition),I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Red (Deluxe Edition),Busy streets and busy lives
Red (Deluxe Edition),And all we know is touch and go
Red (Deluxe Edition),We are alone with our changing minds
Red (Deluxe Edition),We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Red (Deluxe Edition),Or fades in time
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I never (Never)
Red (Deluxe Edition),Saw you coming
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I’ll never (Never)
Red (Deluxe Edition),Be the same
Red (Deluxe Edition),You come around and the armor falls
Red (Deluxe Edition),Pierce the room like a cannonball
Red (Deluxe Edition),Now all we know is don’t let go
Red (Deluxe Edition),"We are alone, just you and me"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Up in your room and our slates are clean
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes"
Red (Deluxe Edition),So you were never a saint
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I've loved in shades of wrong
Red (Deluxe Edition),We learn to live with the pain
Red (Deluxe Edition),Mosaic broken hearts
Red (Deluxe Edition),But this love is brave and wild
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I never (Never)
Red (Deluxe Edition),Saw you coming
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I’ll never (Never)
Red (Deluxe Edition),Be the same
Red (Deluxe Edition),This is a state of grace
Red (Deluxe Edition),This is the worthwhile fight
Red (Deluxe Edition),Love is a ruthless game
Red (Deluxe Edition),Unless you play it good and right
Red (Deluxe Edition),These are the hands of fate
Red (Deluxe Edition),You’re my Achilles heel
Red (Deluxe Edition),This is the golden age
Red (Deluxe Edition),Of something good and right and real
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I never (Never)
Red (Deluxe Edition),Saw you coming
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I’ll never
Red (Deluxe Edition),Be the same
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I never (Never)
Red (Deluxe Edition),Saw you coming
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I’ll never (So you were never a saint)
Red (Deluxe Edition),(And I've loved in shades of wrong)
Red (Deluxe Edition),Be the same (We learn to live with the pain)
Red (Deluxe Edition),(Mosaic broken hearts)
Red (Deluxe Edition),(But this love is brave and wild)
Red (Deluxe Edition),This is a state of grace
Red (Deluxe Edition),This is the worthwhile fight
Red (Deluxe Edition),Love is a ruthless game
Red (Deluxe Edition),Unless you play it good and right
Red (Deluxe Edition),Loving him is like
Red (Deluxe Edition),Driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Faster than the wind, passionate as sin"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Ending so suddenly
Red (Deluxe Edition),Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Red (Deluxe Edition),Once you're already flying through the free fall
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Like the colors in autumn, so bright"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Just before they lose it all
Red (Deluxe Edition),Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Missing him was dark gray, all alone"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Forgetting him was like
Red (Deluxe Edition),Trying to know somebody you never met
Red (Deluxe Edition),But loving him was red
Red (Deluxe Edition),"(Red, red)"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"(Red, red)"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Loving him was red
Red (Deluxe Edition),"(Red, red)"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"(Red, red)"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Touching him was like
Red (Deluxe Edition),Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Red (Deluxe Edition),Memorizing him was as
Red (Deluxe Edition),Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Red (Deluxe Edition),Fighting with him was like
Red (Deluxe Edition),Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Red (Deluxe Edition),Regretting him was like
Red (Deluxe Edition),Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
Red (Deluxe Edition),Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Forgetting him was like
Red (Deluxe Edition),Trying to know somebody you never met
Red (Deluxe Edition),But loving him was red
Red (Deluxe Edition),"(Red, red)"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Oh, red (Red, red)"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Burning red (Red, red)"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"(Red, red)"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go"
Red (Deluxe Edition),But moving on from him is impossible
Red (Deluxe Edition),When I still see it all in my head
Red (Deluxe Edition),In burning red
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Burning, it was red"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Forgetting him was like
Red (Deluxe Edition),Trying to know somebody you never met
Red (Deluxe Edition),'Cause loving him was red
Red (Deluxe Edition),"(Red, red) Yeah, yeah, red (Red, red)"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Burning red (Red, red)"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"(Red, red)"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And that's why (Red, red) he's spinning 'round in my head"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Comes back to me (Red, red), burning red"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"(Red, red) Yeah, yeah"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"(Red, red)"
Red (Deluxe Edition),His love was like
Red (Deluxe Edition),Driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Red (Deluxe Edition),Put your lips close to mine
Red (Deluxe Edition),As long as they don't touch
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Out of focus, eye to eye"
Red (Deluxe Edition),'Til the gravity's too much
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I'll do anything you say
Red (Deluxe Edition),If you say it with your hands
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I'd be smart to walk away
Red (Deluxe Edition),But you're quicksand
Red (Deluxe Edition),This slope is treacherous
Red (Deluxe Edition),This path is reckless
Red (Deluxe Edition),This slope is treacherous
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I-I-I like it
Red (Deluxe Edition),I can't decide if it's a choice
Red (Deluxe Edition),Getting swept away
Red (Deluxe Edition),I hear the sound of my own voice
Red (Deluxe Edition),Asking you to stay
Red (Deluxe Edition),And all we are is skin and bone
Red (Deluxe Edition),Trained to get along
Red (Deluxe Edition),Forever going with the flow
Red (Deluxe Edition),But you're friction
Red (Deluxe Edition),[Chorus]
Red (Deluxe Edition),This slope is treacherous
Red (Deluxe Edition),This path is reckless
Red (Deluxe Edition),This slope is treacherous
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I, I, I like it"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And I will get you, get you alone"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Your name has echoed through my mind
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And I just think you should, think you should know"
Red (Deluxe Edition),That nothing safe is worth the drive
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And I would follow you, follow you home"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I'll follow you, follow you home"
Red (Deluxe Edition),This hope is treacherous
Red (Deluxe Edition),This daydream is dangerous
Red (Deluxe Edition),This hope is treacherous
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And I will get you, get you alone"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Your name has echoed through my mind
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And I just think you should, think you should know"
Red (Deluxe Edition),That nothing safe is worth the drive
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And I would follow you, follow you home"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I'll follow you, follow you home"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I'll follow you, follow you home"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I'll follow you, follow you home"
Red (Deluxe Edition),This slope is treacherous
Red (Deluxe Edition),I-I-I like it
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I was in your sights, you got me alone"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"You found me, you found me, you found me"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And when I fell hard, you took a step back"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Without me, without me, without me"
Red (Deluxe Edition),And he's long gone when he's next to me
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I realize the blame is on me
Red (Deluxe Edition),'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Red (Deluxe Edition),So shame on me now
Red (Deluxe Edition),Flew me to places I'd never been
Red (Deluxe Edition),"'Til you put me down, oh"
Red (Deluxe Edition),I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Red (Deluxe Edition),So shame on me now
Red (Deluxe Edition),Flew me to places I'd never been
Red (Deluxe Edition),Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Oh, oh-oh"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Trouble, trouble, trouble"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Oh, oh-oh"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Trouble, trouble, trouble"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"No apologies, he'll never see you cry"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
Red (Deluxe Edition),"You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning"
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
Red (Deluxe Edition),A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And now I see, now I see, now I see"
Red (Deluxe Edition),He was long gone when he met me
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And I realize the joke is on me, hey"
Red (Deluxe Edition),I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Oh)
Red (Deluxe Edition),So shame on me now
Red (Deluxe Edition),Flew me to places I'd never been
Red (Deluxe Edition),"'Til you put me down, oh"
Red (Deluxe Edition),I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Red (Deluxe Edition),So shame on me now
Red (Deluxe Edition),Flew me to places I'd never been (Yeah)
Red (Deluxe Edition),Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Oh, oh-oh (Yeah)"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Trouble, trouble, trouble"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Oh, oh-oh"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Trouble, trouble, trouble"
Red (Deluxe Edition),And the saddest fear
Red (Deluxe Edition),Comes creeping in
Red (Deluxe Edition),That you never loved me
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Or her, or anyone, or anything"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Yeah
Red (Deluxe Edition),I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Red (Deluxe Edition),So shame on me now
Red (Deluxe Edition),Flew me to places I'd never been (Never been)
Red (Deluxe Edition),"'Til you put me down, oh"
Red (Deluxe Edition),I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Knew it right there)
Red (Deluxe Edition),So shame on me now (Knew it right there)
Red (Deluxe Edition),Flew me to places I'd never been (Ooh)
Red (Deluxe Edition),Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Oh, oh-oh"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Trouble, trouble, trouble (Oh)"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Oh, oh-oh"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Trouble, trouble, trouble"
Red (Deluxe Edition),I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Trouble, trouble, trouble"
Red (Deluxe Edition),I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Trouble, trouble, trouble"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold"
Red (Deluxe Edition),But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And you've still got it in your drawer, even now"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I can picture it after all these days
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I know it's long gone and
Red (Deluxe Edition),That magic's not here no more
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Oh, oh, oh"
Red (Deluxe Edition),'Cause there we are again on that little town street
Red (Deluxe Edition),You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Wind in my hair, I was there"
Red (Deluxe Edition),I remember it all too well
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red"
Red (Deluxe Edition),You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
Red (Deluxe Edition),And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
Red (Deluxe Edition),"You tell me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me"
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I know it's long gone and
Red (Deluxe Edition),There was nothing else I could do
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I forget about you long enough
Red (Deluxe Edition),To forget why I needed to
Red (Deluxe Edition),'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
Red (Deluxe Edition),We're dancing ‘round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Down the stairs, I was there"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I remember it all too well, yeah"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Maybe we got lost in translation
Red (Deluxe Edition),Maybe I asked for too much
Red (Deluxe Edition),But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Red (Deluxe Edition),'Til you tore it all up
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Running scared, I was there"
Red (Deluxe Edition),I remember it all too well
Red (Deluxe Edition),And you call me up again
Red (Deluxe Edition),Just to break me like a promise
Red (Deluxe Edition),So casually cruel in the name of being honest
Red (Deluxe Edition),I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
Red (Deluxe Edition),"'Cause I remember it all, all, all"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Too well
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it"
Red (Deluxe Edition),After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Red (Deluxe Edition),Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
Red (Deluxe Edition),But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Red (Deluxe Edition),'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
Red (Deluxe Edition),You can't get rid of it
Red (Deluxe Edition),"'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah"
Red (Deluxe Edition),'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Red (Deluxe Edition),Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
Red (Deluxe Edition),"It was rare, I was there"
Red (Deluxe Edition),I remember it all too well
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Wind in my hair, you were there"
Red (Deluxe Edition),You remember it all
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Down the stairs, you were there"
Red (Deluxe Edition),You remember it all
Red (Deluxe Edition),"It was rare, I was there"
Red (Deluxe Edition),I remember it all too well
Red (Deluxe Edition),It feels like a perfect night
Red (Deluxe Edition),To dress up like hipsters
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And make fun of our exes, uh-uh, uh-uh"
Red (Deluxe Edition),It feels like a perfect night
Red (Deluxe Edition),For breakfast at midnight
Red (Deluxe Edition),"To fall in love with strangers, uh-uh, uh-uh"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Yeah
Red (Deluxe Edition),"We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
Red (Deluxe Edition),"It's time, oh-oh"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
Red (Deluxe Edition),"You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're
Red (Deluxe Edition),"22, 22"
Red (Deluxe Edition),It seems like one of those nights
Red (Deluxe Edition),This place is too crowded
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Too many cool kids, uh-uh, uh-uh"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"(Who's Taylor Swift, anyway? Ew)"
Red (Deluxe Edition),It seems like one of those nights
Red (Deluxe Edition),We ditch the whole scene
Red (Deluxe Edition),And end up dreaming
Red (Deluxe Edition),Instead of sleeping
Red (Deluxe Edition),Yeah
Red (Deluxe Edition),"We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
Red (Deluxe Edition),"It's time, oh-oh"
Red (Deluxe Edition),(Hey!)
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Everything will be alright (Ooh) if you keep me next to you
Red (Deluxe Edition),"You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Everything will be alright if (Alright)
Red (Deluxe Edition),"We just keep dancing like we're 22 (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)"
Red (Deluxe Edition),22 (I don't know about you)
Red (Deluxe Edition),"22, 22"
Red (Deluxe Edition),It feels like one of those nights
Red (Deluxe Edition),We ditch the whole scene
Red (Deluxe Edition),It feels like one of those nights
Red (Deluxe Edition),We won't be sleeping
Red (Deluxe Edition),It feels like one of those nights
Red (Deluxe Edition),You look like bad news
Red (Deluxe Edition),I gotta have you
Red (Deluxe Edition),I gotta have you
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Ooh, ooh, yeah"
Red (Deluxe Edition),(Hey!)
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Everything will be alright if (Ooh) you keep me next to you
Red (Deluxe Edition),"You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're
Red (Deluxe Edition),"22 (Whoa, oh)"
Red (Deluxe Edition),22 (Dancing like)
Red (Deluxe Edition),"22 (Yeah, yeah), 22, (Yeah, yeah, yeah)"
Red (Deluxe Edition),It feels like one of those nights
Red (Deluxe Edition),We ditch the whole scene
Red (Deluxe Edition),It feels like one of those nights
Red (Deluxe Edition),We won't be sleeping
Red (Deluxe Edition),It feels like one of those nights
Red (Deluxe Edition),You look like bad news
Red (Deluxe Edition),I gotta have you
Red (Deluxe Edition),I gotta have you
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I bet this time of night, you’re still up"
Red (Deluxe Edition),I bet you’re tired from a long hard week
Red (Deluxe Edition),I bet you’re sittin' in your chair by the window
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Looking out at the city, and I bet"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Sometimes you wonder 'bout me
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I just wanna tell you
Red (Deluxe Edition),It takes everything in me not to call you
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I wish I could run to you
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I hope you know that
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Every time I don’t, I almost do, I almost do"
Red (Deluxe Edition),I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
Red (Deluxe Edition),"‘Cause each time you reach out, there’s no reply"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I bet it never, ever occurred to you"
Red (Deluxe Edition),That I can’t say hello to you and risk another goodbye
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I just wanna tell you
Red (Deluxe Edition),It takes everything in me not to call you
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I wish I could run to you
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I hope you know that
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Every time I don’t, I almost do, I almost do"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Oh, we made quite a mess, babe"
Red (Deluxe Edition),It’s probably better off this way
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And I confess, babe"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"In my dreams, you’re touching my face"
Red (Deluxe Edition),And asking me if I want to try again with you
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I almost do
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I just wanna tell you
Red (Deluxe Edition),It takes everything in me not to call you
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I wish I could run to you
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I hope you know that
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Every time I don’t, I almost do, I almost do"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I bet this time of night, you’re still up"
Red (Deluxe Edition),I bet you’re tired from a long hard week
Red (Deluxe Edition),I bet you’re sittin' in your chair by the window
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Looking out at the city, and I hope"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Sometimes you wonder 'bout me
Red (Deluxe Edition),I remember when we broke up the first time
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like"
Red (Deluxe Edition),We hadn't seen each other in a month
Red (Deluxe Edition),When you said you needed space (What?)
Red (Deluxe Edition),Then you come around again and say
Red (Deluxe Edition),"""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"""
Red (Deluxe Edition),Remember how that lasted for a day?
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, I love you"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Red (Deluxe Edition),"We called it off again last night, but"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Red (Deluxe Edition),"This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"We are never, ever, ever getting back together"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"We are never, ever, ever getting back together"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"But we are never, ever, ever, ever"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Getting back together
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Like, ever"
Red (Deluxe Edition),I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right"
Red (Deluxe Edition),And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
Red (Deluxe Edition),With some indie record that's much cooler than mine
Red (Deluxe Edition),Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Red (Deluxe Edition),"You called me up again tonight, but"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Red (Deluxe Edition),"This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"We (We) are never, ever, ever getting back together"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"We are never, ever, ever getting back together"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"(Talk to me) But we are never, ever, ever, ever"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Getting back together
Red (Deluxe Edition),Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Red (Deluxe Edition),Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Red (Deluxe Edition),Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Red (Deluxe Edition),Oh-oh-oh
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I used to think that we were forever, ever"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And I used to say, ""Never say never"""
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, ""I still love you"""
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And I'm like, ""I just, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Like, we are never getting back together, like, ever"""
Red (Deluxe Edition),"(No) We are never, ever, ever getting back together"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"We are never, ever, ever (Ooh) getting back together"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"But we are never, ever, ever, ever"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Getting back together
Red (Deluxe Edition),"We (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, no)"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Getting back together
Red (Deluxe Edition),"We (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, oh)"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Getting back together (Yeah)
Red (Deluxe Edition),"You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"(Talk to me) But we are never, ever, ever, ever"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Getting back together
Red (Deluxe Edition),I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I threw my phone across the room, at you"
Red (Deluxe Edition),I was expecting some dramatic turn away
Red (Deluxe Edition),But you stayed
Red (Deluxe Edition),"This morning, I said we should talk about it"
Red (Deluxe Edition),'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
Red (Deluxe Edition),That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And said, ""Okay, let's talk"""
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I said
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Stay, stay, stay"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad"
Red (Deluxe Edition),But I think that it's best if we both stay
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Who took all of their problems out on me
Red (Deluxe Edition),But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I love you because you have given me
Red (Deluxe Edition),No choice but to
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Stay, stay, stay"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay"
Red (Deluxe Edition),You took the time to memorize me
Red (Deluxe Edition),"My fears, my hopes, and dreams"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I just like hanging out with you, all the time"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"All those times that you didn't leave, it's been occurring to me"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I'd like to hang out with you, for my whole life"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Stay, and I'll be loving you for quite some time"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Stay, stay, stay, stay!"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Stay, stay, stay"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Stay, stay, stay, stay!"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Stay, stay, stay"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad"
Red (Deluxe Edition),But I think that it's best if we both stay
Red (Deluxe Edition),"(Ha-ha-ha, it's so fun)"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Find myself at your door
Red (Deluxe Edition),Just like all those times before
Red (Deluxe Edition),I’m not sure how I got there
Red (Deluxe Edition),All roads they lead me here
Red (Deluxe Edition),I imagine you are home
Red (Deluxe Edition),"In your room, all alone"
Red (Deluxe Edition),And you open your eyes into mine
Red (Deluxe Edition),And everything feels better
Red (Deluxe Edition),And right before your eyes
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I'm breaking, no past"
Red (Deluxe Edition),No reasons why
Red (Deluxe Edition),Just you and me
Red (Deluxe Edition),This is the last time I'm asking you this
Red (Deluxe Edition),Put my name at the top of your list
Red (Deluxe Edition),This is the last time I'm asking you why
Red (Deluxe Edition),"You break my heart in the blink of an eye (Eye, eye)"
Red (Deluxe Edition),You find yourself at my door
Red (Deluxe Edition),Just like all those times before
Red (Deluxe Edition),You wear your best apology
Red (Deluxe Edition),But I was there to watch you leave
Red (Deluxe Edition),And all the times I let you in
Red (Deluxe Edition),Just for you to go again
Red (Deluxe Edition),Disappear when you come back
Red (Deluxe Edition),Everything is better
Red (Deluxe Edition),And right before your eyes
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I'm aching, run fast"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Nowhere to hide
Red (Deluxe Edition),Just you and me
Red (Deluxe Edition),This is the last time I'm asking you this
Red (Deluxe Edition),Put my name at the top of your list
Red (Deluxe Edition),This is the last time I'm asking you why
Red (Deluxe Edition),"You break my heart in the blink of an eye (Eye, eye)"
Red (Deluxe Edition),This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong
Red (Deluxe Edition),This is the last time I say it's been you all along
Red (Deluxe Edition),This is the last time I let you in my door
Red (Deluxe Edition),"This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho"
Red (Deluxe Edition),This is the last time I'm asking you this
Red (Deluxe Edition),Put my name at the top of your list
Red (Deluxe Edition),This is the last time I'm asking you why
Red (Deluxe Edition),You break my heart in the blink of an eye
Red (Deluxe Edition),This is the last time I'm asking you this
Red (Deluxe Edition),(This is the last time I'm asking you this)
Red (Deluxe Edition),Put my name at the top of your list
Red (Deluxe Edition),(Put my name at the top of your list)
Red (Deluxe Edition),This is the last time I'm asking you why
Red (Deluxe Edition),(This is the last time I'm asking you why)
Red (Deluxe Edition),You break my heart in the blink of an eye
Red (Deluxe Edition),(You break my heart)
Red (Deluxe Edition),"This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Last time I'm asking you this
Red (Deluxe Edition),"This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Last time I'm asking you this
Red (Deluxe Edition),"This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Last time I'm asking you this
Red (Deluxe Edition),"This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Last time I'm asking you this
Red (Deluxe Edition),I was reminiscing just the other day
Red (Deluxe Edition),"While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Red (Deluxe Edition),Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Took off faster than a green light, go"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know"
Red (Deluxe Edition),I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
Red (Deluxe Edition),And that was the first day
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And darling, it was good"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Never looking down
Red (Deluxe Edition),And right there where we stood
Red (Deluxe Edition),Was holy ground
Red (Deluxe Edition),Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
Red (Deluxe Edition),We had this big wide city all to ourselves
Red (Deluxe Edition),"We blocked the noise with the sound of, ""I need you"""
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And for the first time, I had something to lose"
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
Red (Deluxe Edition),And the story's got dust on every page
Red (Deluxe Edition),"But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now"
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I see your face in every crowd
Red (Deluxe Edition),"'Cause darling, it was good"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Never looking down
Red (Deluxe Edition),And right there where we stood
Red (Deluxe Edition),Was holy ground
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Tonight, I'm gonna dance"
Red (Deluxe Edition),For all that we've been through
Red (Deluxe Edition),But I don't wanna dance
Red (Deluxe Edition),If I'm not dancing with you
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Tonight, I'm gonna dance"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Like you were in this room
Red (Deluxe Edition),But I don't wanna dance
Red (Deluxe Edition),If I'm not dancing with you
Red (Deluxe Edition),It was good
Red (Deluxe Edition),Never looking down
Red (Deluxe Edition),And right there where we stood
Red (Deluxe Edition),Was holy ground
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Tonight, I'm gonna dance"
Red (Deluxe Edition),For all that we've been through
Red (Deluxe Edition),But I don't wanna dance
Red (Deluxe Edition),If I'm not dancing with you
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Tonight, I'm gonna dance"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Like you were in this room
Red (Deluxe Edition),But I don't wanna dance
Red (Deluxe Edition),If I'm not dancing with you
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait"
Red (Deluxe Edition),We had a beautiful magic love affair
Red (Deluxe Edition),"What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"We both wake in lonely beds, different cities"
Red (Deluxe Edition),And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
Red (Deluxe Edition),And you've got your demons
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And darling, they all look like me"
Red (Deluxe Edition),'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
Red (Deluxe Edition),"What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Silence, the train runs off its tracks"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Hang up, give up, and for the life of us we can't get back"
Red (Deluxe Edition),A beautiful magic love there
Red (Deluxe Edition),"What a sad, beautiful, tragic, beautiful, tragic, beautiful"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Nardo Wick 'Who Want Smoke??' (Live Performance) | Open Mic
Red (Deluxe Edition),"What we had, a beautiful magic love there"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love affair"
Red (Deluxe Edition),We had a beautiful magic love there
Red (Deluxe Edition),"What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair"
Red (Deluxe Edition),New to town with a made up name
Red (Deluxe Edition),"In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame"
Red (Deluxe Edition),And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
Red (Deluxe Edition),You had it figured out since you were in school
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"So overnight, you look like a sixties queen"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Another name goes up in lights
Red (Deluxe Edition),Like diamonds in the sky
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"But can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one?"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Oh, oh, oh"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Now, it’s big black cars and Riviera views"
Red (Deluxe Edition),And your lover in the foyer doesn’t even know you
Red (Deluxe Edition),And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And they tell you that you’re lucky, but you’re so confused"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"'Cause you don’t feel pretty, you just feel used"
Red (Deluxe Edition),And all the young things line up to take your place
Red (Deluxe Edition),Another name goes up in lights
Red (Deluxe Edition),You wonder if you’ll make it out alive
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"But can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one?"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Oh, oh, oh"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"It was a few years later, I showed up here"
Red (Deluxe Edition),And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
Red (Deluxe Edition),"How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out"
Red (Deluxe Edition),They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Red (Deluxe Edition),Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And it took some time, but I understand it now"
Red (Deluxe Edition),‘Cause now my name is up in lights
Red (Deluxe Edition),But I think you got it right
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Oh, whoa, oh, oh"
Red (Deluxe Edition),All I knew this morning when I woke
Red (Deluxe Edition),Is I know something now
Red (Deluxe Edition),Know something now I didn't before
Red (Deluxe Edition),And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Red (Deluxe Edition),Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
Red (Deluxe Edition),"In the back of my mind, making me feel like"
Red (Deluxe Edition),I just wanna know you better
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Know you better, know you better now"
Red (Deluxe Edition),I just wanna know you better
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Know you better, know you better now"

Red (Deluxe Edition),"It was the best night, never would forget how we moved"
Red (Deluxe Edition),The whole place was dressed to the nines
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And we were dancing, dancing"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Like we're made of starlight
Red (Deluxe Edition),Like we're made of starlight
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Picked me up, late one night at the window"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
Red (Deluxe Edition),The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Red (Deluxe Edition),Pretending to be a duchess and a prince
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And I said, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune"""
Red (Deluxe Edition),"It was the best night, never would forget how we moved"
Red (Deluxe Edition),The whole place was dressed to the nines
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And we were dancing, dancing"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Like we're made of starlight, starlight"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Like we're made of starlight, starlight"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"He said, ""Look at you"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Worrying so much about things you can't change
Red (Deluxe Edition),You'll spend your whole life singing the blues
Red (Deluxe Edition),"If you keep thinking that way"""
Red (Deluxe Edition),"He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"""Don't you see the starlight, starlight?"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Don't you dream impossible things?"""
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Like, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune"""
Red (Deluxe Edition),"It was the best night, never would forget how we moved"
Red (Deluxe Edition),The whole place was dressed to the nines
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And we were dancing, dancing"

Red (Deluxe Edition),"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Don't you dream impossible things?
Red (Deluxe Edition),Took a deep breath in the mirror
Red (Deluxe Edition),"He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Turn the lock and put my headphones on
Red (Deluxe Edition),"He always said he didn't get this song but I do, I do"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Walked in, expecting you'd be late"
Red (Deluxe Edition),But you got here early and you stand and wave
Red (Deluxe Edition),I walk to you
Red (Deluxe Edition),You pull my chair out and help me in
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And you don't know how nice that is, but I do"
Red (Deluxe Edition),And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
Red (Deluxe Edition),I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
Red (Deluxe Edition),I've been spending the last eight months
Red (Deluxe Edition),Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
Red (Deluxe Edition),"But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again"
Red (Deluxe Edition),You said you never met one girl who
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Had as many James Taylor records as you, but I do"
Red (Deluxe Edition),We tell stories and you don't know why
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I'm coming off a little shy, but I do"
Red (Deluxe Edition),But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
Red (Deluxe Edition),I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
Red (Deluxe Edition),I've been spending the last eight months
Red (Deluxe Edition),Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
Red (Deluxe Edition),"But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again"
Red (Deluxe Edition),And we walked down the block to my car
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I almost brought him up
Red (Deluxe Edition),But you start to talk about the movies
Red (Deluxe Edition),That your family watches every single Christmas
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I want to talk about that
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And for the first time, what's past is past"
Red (Deluxe Edition),'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
Red (Deluxe Edition),I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
Red (Deluxe Edition),I've been spending the last eight months
Red (Deluxe Edition),Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
Red (Deluxe Edition),"But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again"
Red (Deluxe Edition),You should've been there
Red (Deluxe Edition),Should've burst through the door
Red (Deluxe Edition),"With that ""Baby, I'm right here"" smile"
Red (Deluxe Edition),And it would've felt like
Red (Deluxe Edition),A million little shining stars had just aligned
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I would've been so happy
Red (Deluxe Edition),Christmas lights glisten
Red (Deluxe Edition),I've got my eye on the door
Red (Deluxe Edition),Just waiting for you to walk in
Red (Deluxe Edition),But the time is ticking
Red (Deluxe Edition),People ask me how I've been
Red (Deluxe Edition),As I comb back through my memory
Red (Deluxe Edition),How you said you'd be here
Red (Deluxe Edition),You said you'd be here
Red (Deluxe Edition),And it was like slow motion
Red (Deluxe Edition),Standing there in my party dress
Red (Deluxe Edition),In red lipstick
Red (Deluxe Edition),With no one to impress
Red (Deluxe Edition),And they're all laughing
Red (Deluxe Edition),As I'm looking around the room
Red (Deluxe Edition),But there was one thing missing
Red (Deluxe Edition),And that was the moment I knew
Red (Deluxe Edition),And the hours pass by
Red (Deluxe Edition),Now I just wanna be alone
Red (Deluxe Edition),But your close friends always seem to know
Red (Deluxe Edition),When there's something really wrong
Red (Deluxe Edition),So they follow me down the hall
Red (Deluxe Edition),And there in the bathroom
Red (Deluxe Edition),I try not to fall apart
Red (Deluxe Edition),And the sinking feeling starts
Red (Deluxe Edition),As I say hopelessly
Red (Deluxe Edition),"""He said he'd be here"""
Red (Deluxe Edition),And it was like slow motion
Red (Deluxe Edition),Standing there in my party dress
Red (Deluxe Edition),In red lipstick
Red (Deluxe Edition),With no one to impress
Red (Deluxe Edition),And they're all laughing
Red (Deluxe Edition),And asking me about you
Red (Deluxe Edition),But there was one thing missing (missing)
Red (Deluxe Edition),And that was the moment I knew
Red (Deluxe Edition),What do you say
Red (Deluxe Edition),When tears are streaming down your face
Red (Deluxe Edition),In front of everyone you know?
Red (Deluxe Edition),And what do you do
Red (Deluxe Edition),When the one who means the most to you
Red (Deluxe Edition),Is the one who didn't show?
Red (Deluxe Edition),You should've been here
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I would've been so happy
Red (Deluxe Edition),And it was like slow motion
Red (Deluxe Edition),Standing there in my party dress
Red (Deluxe Edition),In red lipstick
Red (Deluxe Edition),With no one to impress
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And they're all standing around me, singing"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"""Happy birthday to you"""
Red (Deluxe Edition),But there was one thing missing
Red (Deluxe Edition),And that was the moment I knew
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Red (Deluxe Edition),You called me later
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And said, ""I'm sorry I didn't make it"""
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And I said, ""I'm sorry, too"""
Red (Deluxe Edition),And that was the moment I knew
Red (Deluxe Edition),You said it in a simple way
Red (Deluxe Edition),"4 AM, the second day"
Red (Deluxe Edition),How strange that I don't know you at all
Red (Deluxe Edition),Stumbled through the long goodbye
Red (Deluxe Edition),"One last kiss, then catch your flight"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Right when I was just about to fall
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I told myself, don't get attached"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"But in my mind, I play it back"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Spinning faster than the plane that took you
Red (Deluxe Edition),And this is when the feeling sinks in
Red (Deluxe Edition),I don't wanna miss you like this
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Come back, be here, come back, be here"
Red (Deluxe Edition),I guess you're in New York today
Red (Deluxe Edition),I don't wanna need you this way
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Come back, be here, come back, be here"
Red (Deluxe Edition),The delicate beginning rush
Red (Deluxe Edition),The feeling you can know so much
Red (Deluxe Edition),Without knowing anything at all
Red (Deluxe Edition),And now that I can put this down
Red (Deluxe Edition),If I had known what I know now
Red (Deluxe Edition),I never would've played so nonchalant
Red (Deluxe Edition),Taxi cabs and busy streets
Red (Deluxe Edition),That never bring you back to me
Red (Deluxe Edition),I can't help but wish you took me with you
Red (Deluxe Edition),And this is when the feeling sinks in
Red (Deluxe Edition),I don't wanna miss you like this
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Come back, be here, come back, be here"
Red (Deluxe Edition),I guess you're in London today
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I don't wanna need you this way
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Come back, be here, come back, be here"
Red (Deluxe Edition),This is falling in love in the cruelest way
Red (Deluxe Edition),This is falling for you when you are worlds away
Red (Deluxe Edition),"In New York, be here"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"But you're in London, and I break down"
Red (Deluxe Edition),'Cause it's not fair that you're not around
Red (Deluxe Edition),This is when the feeling sinks in
Red (Deluxe Edition),I don't wanna miss you like this
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Come back, be here, come back, be here"
Red (Deluxe Edition),I guess you're in New York today
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I don't wanna need you this way
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Come back, be here, come back, be here"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Oh-oh, oh-oh"
Red (Deluxe Edition),I don't wanna miss you like this
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Oh-oh, oh-oh"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Come back, be here"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Come back, be here"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Don't look at me, you got a girl at home"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Don't look at me, you got a girl at home"
Red (Deluxe Edition),And everybody knows that
Red (Deluxe Edition),I don't even know her
Red (Deluxe Edition),But I feel a responsibility to do what's upstanding and right
Red (Deluxe Edition),"It's kinda like a code, yeah"
Red (Deluxe Edition),And you've been getting closer and closer
Red (Deluxe Edition),And crossing so many lines
Red (Deluxe Edition),And it would be a fine proposition
Red (Deluxe Edition),If I was a stupid girl
Red (Deluxe Edition),"But, honey, I am no one's exception"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"This, I have previously learned"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"So don't look at me, you got a girl at home"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Don't look at me, you got a girl at home"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And everybody knows that, everybody knows that"
Red (Deluxe Edition),I see you turn off your phone
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And now you've got me alone, and I say"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Don't look at me, you got a girl at home"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And everybody knows that, everybody knows that"
Red (Deluxe Edition),I just want to make sure
Red (Deluxe Edition),You understand perfectly
Red (Deluxe Edition),You're the kind of man who makes me sad
Red (Deluxe Edition),"While she waits up, you chase down the newest thing"
Red (Deluxe Edition),And take for granted what you have
Red (Deluxe Edition),And it would be a fine proposition
Red (Deluxe Edition),If I was a stupid girl
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And, yeah, I might go with it"
Red (Deluxe Edition),If I hadn't once been just like her
Red (Deluxe Edition),"So don't look at me, you got a girl at home"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Don't look at me, you got a girl at home"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And everybody knows that, everybody knows that"
Red (Deluxe Edition),I see you turn off your phone
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And now you've got me alone, and I say"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Don't look at me, you got a girl at home"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And everybody knows that, everybody knows that"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Call a cab, lose my number"
Red (Deluxe Edition),You're about to lose your girl
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Call a cab, lose my number"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Let's consider this lesson learned
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Don't look at me, you got a girl at home"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Don't look at me, you got a girl at home"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And everybody knows that, everybody knows that"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Want to see you pick up your phone
Red (Deluxe Edition),And tell her you're coming home
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Don't look at me, you got a girl at home"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And everybody knows that, everybody knows that"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Don't look at me, you got a girl at home"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And everybody knows that, everybody knows that"
Red (Deluxe Edition),It would be a fine proposition
Red (Deluxe Edition),If I hadn't once been just like her
Red (Deluxe Edition),Put your lips close to mine
Red (Deluxe Edition),As long as they don’t touch
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Out of focus, eye to eye"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Till the gravity’s too much
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I’ll do anything you say
Red (Deluxe Edition),If you say it with your hands
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I’d be smart to walk away
Red (Deluxe Edition),But you’re quicksand
Red (Deluxe Edition),This slope is treacherous
Red (Deluxe Edition),This path is reckless
Red (Deluxe Edition),This slope is treacherous
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And I, I, I, like it"
Red (Deluxe Edition),I can’t decide if it’s a choice
Red (Deluxe Edition),Getting swept away
Red (Deluxe Edition),I hear the sound of my own voice
Red (Deluxe Edition),Asking you to stay
Red (Deluxe Edition),And all we are is skin and bone
Red (Deluxe Edition),Trained to get along
Red (Deluxe Edition),Forever going with the flow
Red (Deluxe Edition),But you’re friction
Red (Deluxe Edition),This slope is treacherous
Red (Deluxe Edition),This path is reckless
Red (Deluxe Edition),This slope is treacherous
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I, I, I, like it"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And I will get you, get you alone"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Your name has echoed through my mind
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I just think you should
Red (Deluxe Edition),Think you should know
Red (Deluxe Edition),That nothing safe is worth the drive
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And I would follow you, follow you home"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I’ll follow you, follow you home"
Red (Deluxe Edition),This hope is treacherous
Red (Deluxe Edition),This daydream is dangerous
Red (Deluxe Edition),This hope is treacherous
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I, I, I"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I, I, I"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I, I, I"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
Red (Deluxe Edition),"And I will get you, get you alone"

Red (Deluxe Edition),"I’ll follow you, follow you home"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I’ll follow you, follow you home"
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I’ll follow you, follow you home"
Red (Deluxe Edition),This slope is treacherous
Red (Deluxe Edition),"I, I, I, like it"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Loving him is like
Red (Deluxe Edition),Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Loving him is like
Red (Deluxe Edition),Trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the freefall
Red (Deluxe Edition),Like the colors in autumn
Red (Deluxe Edition),"So bright, just before they lose it all"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Missing him was dark grey, all alone"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
Red (Deluxe Edition),But loving him was red
Red (Deluxe Edition),Loving him was red
Red (Deluxe Edition),Touching him was like
Red (Deluxe Edition),Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Red (Deluxe Edition),Memorizing him was as
Red (Deluxe Edition),Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Red (Deluxe Edition),Fighting with him was like
Red (Deluxe Edition),Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Red (Deluxe Edition),Regretting him was like
Red (Deluxe Edition),Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
Red (Deluxe Edition),Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Missing him was dark grey, all alone"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
Red (Deluxe Edition),But loving him was red
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Oh, red"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Burning red
Red (Deluxe Edition),Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go"
Red (Deluxe Edition),But moving on from him is impossible
Red (Deluxe Edition),When I still see it all in my head
Red (Deluxe Edition),In burning red
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Burning, it was red"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Missing him was dark grey, all alone"
Red (Deluxe Edition),Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
Red (Deluxe Edition),'Cause loving him was red
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Yeah, yeah, red"
Red (Deluxe Edition),We're burning red
Red (Deluxe Edition),And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Burning red, burning red"
Red (Deluxe Edition),His love was like
Red (Deluxe Edition),Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
Red (Deluxe Edition),I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Red (Deluxe Edition),Busy streets and busy lives
Red (Deluxe Edition),And all we know is touch and go
Red (Deluxe Edition),We are alone with our changing minds
Red (Deluxe Edition),"We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time"
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I never saw you coming
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I’ll never be the same
Red (Deluxe Edition),You come around and the armor falls
Red (Deluxe Edition),Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Now all we know, is don’t let go"
Red (Deluxe Edition),We are alone just you and me
Red (Deluxe Edition),Up in your room and our slates are clean
Red (Deluxe Edition),"Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes"
Red (Deluxe Edition),So you were never a saint
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I've loved in shades of wrong
Red (Deluxe Edition),We learn to live with the pain
Red (Deluxe Edition),Mosaic broken hearts
Red (Deluxe Edition),But this love is brave and wild
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I never saw you coming
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I’ll never be the same
Red (Deluxe Edition),This is a state of grace
Red (Deluxe Edition),This is the worthwhile fight
Red (Deluxe Edition),Love is a ruthless game
Red (Deluxe Edition),Unless you play it good and right
Red (Deluxe Edition),These are the hands of fate
Red (Deluxe Edition),You’re my Achilles heel
Red (Deluxe Edition),This is the golden age of something good
Red (Deluxe Edition),And right and real
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I never saw you coming
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I’ll never be the same
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I never saw you coming
Red (Deluxe Edition),And I’ll never be the same
Red (Deluxe Edition),This is a state of grace
Red (Deluxe Edition),This is a worthwhile fight
Red (Deluxe Edition),Love is a ruthless game
Red (Deluxe Edition),Unless you play it good and right

1989 (Deluxe),"Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out"
1989 (Deluxe),It could burn out
1989 (Deluxe),"'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns"
1989 (Deluxe),"They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run"
1989 (Deluxe),"Baby, I know places we won't be found"
1989 (Deluxe),And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
1989 (Deluxe),"'Cause I, I know places we can hide"

1989 (Deluxe),When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
1989 (Deluxe),"It was months and months of back and forth (Oh-oh, oh-oh)"
1989 (Deluxe),You're still all over me
1989 (Deluxe),Like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore
1989 (Deluxe),Hung my head as I lost the war
1989 (Deluxe),And the sky turned black like a perfect storm
1989 (Deluxe),Rain came pouring down
1989 (Deluxe),"When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe"
1989 (Deluxe),And by morning
1989 (Deluxe),"Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean"
1989 (Deluxe),"(Oh, oh, oh, oh)"
1989 (Deluxe),"There was nothing left to do (Oh-oh, oh-oh)"
1989 (Deluxe),When the butterflies turned to
1989 (Deluxe),Dust that covered my whole room
1989 (Deluxe),"So I punched a hole in the roof (Oh-oh, oh-oh)"
1989 (Deluxe),Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
1989 (Deluxe),"The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud"
1989 (Deluxe),But no one heard a thing
1989 (Deluxe),Rain came pouring down
1989 (Deluxe),"When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe"
1989 (Deluxe),And by morning
1989 (Deluxe),"Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean"
1989 (Deluxe),"(Oh, oh, oh, oh)"
1989 (Deluxe),I think I am finally clean
1989 (Deluxe),"(Oh, oh)"
1989 (Deluxe),"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh"

1989 (Deluxe),"(Oh, oh)"
1989 (Deluxe),"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh"
1989 (Deluxe),"Ten months sober, I must admit"
1989 (Deluxe),"Just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it"
1989 (Deluxe),"Ten months older, I won't give in"
1989 (Deluxe),"Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it"
1989 (Deluxe),"The drought was the very worst (Oh-oh, oh-oh)"
1989 (Deluxe),When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
1989 (Deluxe),(Oh)
1989 (Deluxe),The rain came pouring down
1989 (Deluxe),"When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe"
1989 (Deluxe),And by morning

1989 (Deluxe),"(Oh, oh)"
1989 (Deluxe),"Oh-oh, oh-oh"
1989 (Deluxe),"(Oh, oh, oh)"
1989 (Deluxe),Think I'm finally clean
1989 (Deluxe),Flashing lights and we
1989 (Deluxe),Took a wrong turn and we
1989 (Deluxe),Fell down a rabbit hole
1989 (Deluxe),You held on tight to me
1989 (Deluxe),'Cause nothing's as it seems
1989 (Deluxe),And spinning out of control
1989 (Deluxe),Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
1989 (Deluxe),Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
1989 (Deluxe),Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?
1989 (Deluxe),"Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?"
1989 (Deluxe),I felt your arms twistin' around me
1989 (Deluxe),I should have slept with one eye open at night
1989 (Deluxe),We found Wonderland
1989 (Deluxe),You and I got lost in it
1989 (Deluxe),"And we pretended it could last forever (Eh, eh)"
1989 (Deluxe),We found Wonderland
1989 (Deluxe),You and I got lost in it

1989 (Deluxe),In Wonderland
1989 (Deluxe),"(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)"
1989 (Deluxe),In Wonderland
1989 (Deluxe),So we went on our way
1989 (Deluxe),Too in love to think straight
1989 (Deluxe),"All alone, or so it seemed"
1989 (Deluxe),But there were strangers watching
1989 (Deluxe),And whispers turned to talking
1989 (Deluxe),"And talking turned to screams, oh"
1989 (Deluxe),Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
1989 (Deluxe),Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
1989 (Deluxe),Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?
1989 (Deluxe),"Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?"
1989 (Deluxe),I felt your arms twistin' around me
1989 (Deluxe),It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind

1989 (Deluxe),"Whoa, in Wonderland"
1989 (Deluxe),"I reached for you, but you were gone"
1989 (Deluxe),I knew I had to go back home
1989 (Deluxe),You searched the world for something else
1989 (Deluxe),To make you feel like what we had
1989 (Deluxe),"And in the end, in Wonderland"
1989 (Deluxe),We both went mad
1989 (Deluxe),Oh
1989 (Deluxe),We found Wonderland
1989 (Deluxe),You and I got lost in it
1989 (Deluxe),And we pretended it could last forever
1989 (Deluxe),"Last forever (Eh, eh)"

1989 (Deluxe),In Wonderland
1989 (Deluxe),"One look, dark room"
1989 (Deluxe),Meant just for you
1989 (Deluxe),"Time moved too fast, you play it back"
1989 (Deluxe),"Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke"
1989 (Deluxe),"No proof, not much, but you saw enough"
1989 (Deluxe),"Small talk, he drives"
1989 (Deluxe),Coffee at midnight
1989 (Deluxe),The light reflects the chain on your neck
1989 (Deluxe),"He says, ""Look up"""
1989 (Deluxe),And your shoulders brush
1989 (Deluxe),"No proof, one touch, but you felt enough"
1989 (Deluxe),"You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you"
1989 (Deluxe),"You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you"

1989 (Deluxe),You kiss on sidewalks
1989 (Deluxe),You fight and you talk

Lover,And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Lover,"Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true"
Lover,I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
Lover,And I snuck in through the garden gate
Lover,Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
Lover,"And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth"
Lover,"I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"""

Lover,"(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)"
Lover,We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
Lover,"And this is our place, we make the rules"
Lover,"And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear"
Lover,Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?
Lover,Can I go where you go?
Lover,Can we always be this close?
Lover,"Forever and ever, ah"
Lover,"Take me out, and take me home"
Lover,"You're my, my, my, my lover"
Lover,We could let our friends crash in the living room
Lover,"This is our place, we make the call"
Lover,And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
Lover,"I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all"
Lover,Can I go where you go?
Lover,Can we always be this close?
Lover,"Forever and ever, ah"
Lover,"Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)"
Lover,"You're my, my, my, my lover"
Lover,"Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?"
Lover,With every guitar string scar on my hand
Lover,I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
Lover,My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
Lover,All's well that ends well to end up with you
Lover,Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
Lover,And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me

Lover,"Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover"
Lover,"I would be complex, I would be cool"
Lover,They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
Lover,And that would be okay for me to do
Lover,Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you
Lover,I’d be a fearless leader
Lover,I'd be an alpha type
Lover,When everyone believes ya
Lover,What's that like?
Lover,I’m so sick of running as fast as I can
Lover,Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
Lover,And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
Lover,"'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man"
Lover,I'd be the man
Lover,I'd be the man
Lover,"They'd say I hustled, put in the work"
Lover,They wouldn’t shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
Lover,"What I was wearing, if I was rude"
Lover,Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
Lover,"And they would toast to me, oh, let the players play"
Lover,I’d be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez
Lover,I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Lover,Wondering if I’d get there quicker if I was a man
Lover,And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
Lover,"'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man"
Lover,I’d be the man
Lover,I'd be the man
Lover,What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
Lover,And getting bitches and models?
Lover,And it's all good if you're bad
Lover,And it's okay if you're mad
Lover,If I was out flashing my dollars
Lover,"I'd be a bitch, not a baller"
Lover,They'd paint me out to be bad
Lover,"So, it's okay that I'm mad"
Lover,I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Lover,Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (You know that)
Lover,And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
Lover,'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man)
Lover,Then I'd be the man (Then I'd be the man)

Lover,"Combat, I'm ready for combat"
Lover,"I say I don't want that, but what if I do?"
Lover,'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
Lover,I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you
Lover,"Easy they come, easy they go"
Lover,"I jump from the train, I ride off alone"
Lover,"I never grew up, it's getting so old"
Lover,Help me hold on to you
Lover,"I've been the archer, I've been the prey"
Lover,"Who could ever leave me, darling"
Lover,But who could stay?
Lover,"Dark side, I search for your dark side"
Lover,"But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?"
Lover,And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Lover,Then I hate my reflection for years and years
Lover,"I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost"
Lover,"The room is on fire, invisible smoke"
Lover,And all of my heroes die all alone
Lover,Help me hold on to you
Lover,"I've been the archer, I've been the prey"
Lover,"Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling"
Lover,But who could stay?
Lover,"(I see right through me, I see right through me)"

Lover,"Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress"
Lover,"Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard"

Lover,The moon is high
Lover,Like your friends were the night that we first met
Lover,Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Lover,Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
Lover,The wine is cold
Lover,Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Lover,Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Lover,Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe
Lover,(Ayy)
Lover,Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh)

Lover,"In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool"
Lover,"When you jumped in first, I went in too"
Lover,I'm with you even if it makes me blue

Lover,We were in the backseat
Lover,Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
Lover,"""I rent a place on Cornelia Street"""
Lover,I say casually in the car
Lover,We were a fresh page on the desk
Lover,Filling in the blanks as we go
Lover,As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Lover,Leading us home
Lover,"And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends"
Lover,I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Lover,That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
Lover,I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

Lover,"Windows flung right open, autumn air"
Lover,Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
Lover,We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Lover,Memorize the creaks in the floor
Lover,"Back when we were card sharks, playing games"
Lover,I thought you were leading me on
Lover,"I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street"
Lover,Before you even knew I was gone
Lover,"But then you called, showed your hand"
Lover,I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Lover,"Sat on the roof, you and I"
Lover,"I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends"
Lover,I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Lover,That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
Lover,I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

Lover,Sacred new beginnings
Lover,"That became my religion, listen"
Lover,I hope I never lose you

Lover,Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Lover,Flashbacks waking me up
Lover,"I get drunk, but it's not enough"
Lover,’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
Lover,I look through the windows of this love
Lover,Even though we boarded them up
Lover,Chandelier's still flickering here
Lover,’Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
Lover,It's death by a thousand cuts
Lover,"I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home"
Lover,I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
Lover,"They say, ""I don't know"""
Lover,And what once was ours is no one's now
Lover,"I see you everywhere, the only thing we share"
Lover,Is this small town
Lover,"You said it was a great love, one for the ages"

Lover,"My heart, my hips, my body, my love"
Lover,Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Lover,Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Lover,Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Lover,"Our songs, our films, united we stand"
Lover,"Our country, guess it was a lawless land"
Lover,Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Lover,Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
Lover,"My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust"
Lover,Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Lover,"Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough"
Lover,"But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts"
Lover,"I get drunk, but it's not enough"
Lover,'Cause you're not my baby

Lover,It's death by a thousand cuts (You didn't touch)
Lover,Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Lover,"My body, my love, my trust (It's death by a thousand cuts)"
Lover,"But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no"
Lover,I take the long way home
Lover,I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
Lover,"They say, ""I don't know"""

evermore (deluxe version),I'm begging for you to take my hand
evermore (deluxe version),"Wreck my plans, that's my man"
evermore (deluxe version),"The more that you say, the less I know"

evermore (deluxe version),That's my man
evermore (deluxe version),"Hey, that's my man"
evermore (deluxe version),I'm begging for you to take my hand
evermore (deluxe version),"Wreck my plans, that's my man"
evermore (deluxe version),You booked the night train for a reason
evermore (deluxe version),So you could sit there in this hurt
evermore (deluxe version),Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
evermore (deluxe version),You're not sure which is worse
evermore (deluxe version),Because I dropped your hand while dancing
evermore (deluxe version),Left you out there standing
evermore (deluxe version),Crestfallen on the landing
evermore (deluxe version),Champagne problems
evermore (deluxe version),Your mom's ring in your pocket
evermore (deluxe version),My picture in your wallet
evermore (deluxe version),"Your heart was glass, I dropped it"
evermore (deluxe version),Champagne problems
evermore (deluxe version),You told your family for a reason
evermore (deluxe version),You couldn't keep it in
evermore (deluxe version),Your sister splashed out on the bottle
evermore (deluxe version),Now no one's celebrating
evermore (deluxe version),"Dom Pérignon, you brought it"
evermore (deluxe version),No crowd of friends applauded
evermore (deluxe version),Your hometown skeptics called it
evermore (deluxe version),Champagne problems
evermore (deluxe version),"You had a speech, you're speechless"
evermore (deluxe version),Love slipped beyond your reaches
evermore (deluxe version),And I couldn't give a reason
evermore (deluxe version),Champagne problems
evermore (deluxe version),Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
evermore (deluxe version),November flush and your flannel cure
evermore (deluxe version),"""This dorm was once a madhouse"""
evermore (deluxe version),"I made a joke, ""Well, it's made for me"""
evermore (deluxe version),"How evergreen, our group of friends"
evermore (deluxe version),Don't think we'll say that word again
evermore (deluxe version),And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
evermore (deluxe version),That we once walked through
evermore (deluxe version),"One for the money, two for the show"
evermore (deluxe version),I never was ready so I watch you go
evermore (deluxe version),Sometimes you just don't know the answer
evermore (deluxe version),'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
evermore (deluxe version),"""She would've made such a lovely bride"
evermore (deluxe version),"What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said"
evermore (deluxe version),But you'll find the real thing instead
evermore (deluxe version),She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred
evermore (deluxe version),And hold your hand while dancing
evermore (deluxe version),Never leave you standing
evermore (deluxe version),Crestfallen on the landing
evermore (deluxe version),With champagne problems
evermore (deluxe version),Your mom's ring in your pocket
evermore (deluxe version),Her picture in your wallet
evermore (deluxe version),You won't remember all my
evermore (deluxe version),Champagne problems
evermore (deluxe version),You won't remember all my
evermore (deluxe version),Champagne problems
evermore (deluxe version),"Gleaming, twinkling"
evermore (deluxe version),Eyes like sinking ships on waters
evermore (deluxe version),"So inviting, I almost jump in"
evermore (deluxe version),"But I don't like a gold rush, gold rush"
evermore (deluxe version),I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
evermore (deluxe version),I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
evermore (deluxe version),Everybody wants you
evermore (deluxe version),Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
evermore (deluxe version),"Walk past, quick brush"
evermore (deluxe version),"I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush"
evermore (deluxe version),I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
evermore (deluxe version),Everybody wants you
evermore (deluxe version),But I don't like a gold rush
evermore (deluxe version),What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
evermore (deluxe version),With your hair falling into place like dominoes
evermore (deluxe version),I see me padding across your wooden floors
evermore (deluxe version),With my Eagles t-shirt hanging from the door
evermore (deluxe version),"At dinner parties, I call you out on your contrarian shit"
evermore (deluxe version),And the coastal town we wandered 'round had nеver seen a love as pure as it
evermore (deluxe version),And thеn it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
evermore (deluxe version),'Cause it could never be
evermore (deluxe version),"'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush"
evermore (deluxe version),I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
evermore (deluxe version),I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
evermore (deluxe version),Everybody wants you

evermore (deluxe version),But I don't like a gold rush
evermore (deluxe version),What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
evermore (deluxe version),With your hair falling into place like dominoes
evermore (deluxe version),My mind turns your life into folklore
evermore (deluxe version),I can't dare to dream about you anymore
evermore (deluxe version),At dinner parties I won't call you out on your contrarian shit
evermore (deluxe version),And the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it
evermore (deluxe version),'Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
evermore (deluxe version),'Cause it will never be
evermore (deluxe version),"Gleaming, twinkling"
evermore (deluxe version),Eyes like sinking ships on waters
evermore (deluxe version),"So inviting, I almost jump in"
evermore (deluxe version),If I wanted to know who you were hanging with
evermore (deluxe version),"While I was gone, I would've asked you"
evermore (deluxe version),"It's the kind of cold, fogs up windshield glass"
evermore (deluxe version),But I felt it when I passed you
evermore (deluxe version),"There's an ache in you, put there by the ache in me"
evermore (deluxe version),But if it's all the same to you
evermore (deluxe version),It's the same to me
evermore (deluxe version),So we could call it even
evermore (deluxe version),"You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend"
evermore (deluxe version),"​'Tis the damn season, write this down"
evermore (deluxe version),I'm stayin' at my parents' house
evermore (deluxe version),And the road not taken looks real good now
evermore (deluxe version),And it always leads to you and my hometown
evermore (deluxe version),I parkеd my car right between the Methodist
evermore (deluxe version),And thе school that used to be ours
evermore (deluxe version),The holidays linger like bad perfume
evermore (deluxe version),"You can run, but only so far"
evermore (deluxe version),"I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave"
evermore (deluxe version),"But if it's okay with you, it's okay with me"
evermore (deluxe version),We could call it even
evermore (deluxe version),"You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend"
evermore (deluxe version),"​'Tis the damn season, write this down"
evermore (deluxe version),I'm stayin' at my parents' house
evermore (deluxe version),And the road not taken looks real good now
evermore (deluxe version),"Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires"
evermore (deluxe version),"Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out"
evermore (deluxe version),We could just ride around
evermore (deluxe version),And the road not taken looks real good now
evermore (deluxe version),And it always leads to you and my hometown
evermore (deluxe version),Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake
evermore (deluxe version),I won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay
evermore (deluxe version),So I'll go back to L.A. and the so-called friends
evermore (deluxe version),Who'll write books about me if I ever make it
evermore (deluxe version),And wonder about the only soul
evermore (deluxe version),Who can tell which smiles I'm fakin'
evermore (deluxe version),And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own
evermore (deluxe version),To leave the warmest bed I've ever known
evermore (deluxe version),We could call it even
evermore (deluxe version),Even though I'm leaving
evermore (deluxe version),And I'll be yours for the weekend
evermore (deluxe version),​'Tis the damn season
evermore (deluxe version),We could call it even
evermore (deluxe version),"You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend"
evermore (deluxe version),"​'Tis the damn season, write this down"
evermore (deluxe version),I'm stayin' at my parents' house
evermore (deluxe version),And the road not taken looks real good now
evermore (deluxe version),"Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires"
evermore (deluxe version),"Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out"
evermore (deluxe version),We could just ride around
evermore (deluxe version),And the road not taken looks real good now
evermore (deluxe version),And it always leads to you and my hometown
evermore (deluxe version),It always leads to you and my hometown
evermore (deluxe version),I sit and watch you reading with your head low
evermore (deluxe version),I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed
evermore (deluxe version),I sit and watch you
evermore (deluxe version),I notice everything you do or don't do
evermore (deluxe version),"You're so much older and wiser, and I"
evermore (deluxe version),I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
evermore (deluxe version),Use my best colors for your portrait
evermore (deluxe version),Lay the table with the fancy shit
evermore (deluxe version),And watch you tolerate it
evermore (deluxe version),"If it's all in my head, tell me now"
evermore (deluxe version),Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
evermore (deluxe version),I know my love should be celebrated
evermore (deluxe version),But you tolerate it
evermore (deluxe version),I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
evermore (deluxe version),I take your indiscretions all in good fun
evermore (deluxe version),"I sit and listеn, I polish plates until they gleam and glistеn"
evermore (deluxe version),You're so much older and wiser and I
evermore (deluxe version),I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
evermore (deluxe version),Use my best colors for your portrait
evermore (deluxe version),Lay the table with the fancy shit
evermore (deluxe version),And watch you tolerate it
evermore (deluxe version),"If it's all in my head, tell me now"
evermore (deluxe version),Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
evermore (deluxe version),I know my love should be celebrated
evermore (deluxe version),But you tolerate it
evermore (deluxe version),"While you were out building other worlds, where was I?"
evermore (deluxe version),Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?
evermore (deluxe version),"I made you my temple, my mural, my sky"
evermore (deluxe version),Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life
evermore (deluxe version),Drawing hearts in the byline
evermore (deluxe version),Always taking up too much space or time
evermore (deluxe version),"You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I"
evermore (deluxe version),Break free and leave us in ruins
evermore (deluxe version),Took this dagger in me and removed it
evermore (deluxe version),"Gain the weight of you, then lose it"
evermore (deluxe version),"Believe me, I could do it"
evermore (deluxe version),"If it's all in my head, tell me now"
evermore (deluxe version),Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
evermore (deluxe version),I know my love should be celebrated
evermore (deluxe version),But you tolerate it
evermore (deluxe version),I sit and watch you
evermore (deluxe version),He did it
evermore (deluxe version),He did it
evermore (deluxe version),Este's a friend of mine
evermore (deluxe version),We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
evermore (deluxe version),Este's been losin' sleep
evermore (deluxe version),"Her husband's actin' different, and it smells like infidelity"
evermore (deluxe version),"She says, ""That ain't my Merlot on his mouth"
evermore (deluxe version),"That ain't my jewelry on our joint account"""
evermore (deluxe version),"No, there ain't no doubt"
evermore (deluxe version),I think I'm gonna call him out
evermore (deluxe version),"She says, ""I think he did it, but I just can't prove it"""
evermore (deluxe version),"I think he did it, but I just can't prove it"
evermore (deluxe version),"I think he did it, but I just can't prove it"
evermore (deluxe version),"No, no body, no crime"
evermore (deluxe version),But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die
evermore (deluxe version),"No, no"
evermore (deluxe version),I think he did it
evermore (deluxe version),"No, no"
evermore (deluxe version),He did it
evermore (deluxe version),Este wasn't there Tuesday night at Olive Gardеn
evermore (deluxe version),At her job or anywhere
evermore (deluxe version),Hе reports his missing wife
evermore (deluxe version),And I noticed when I passed his house
evermore (deluxe version),His truck has got some brand new tires
evermore (deluxe version),And his mistress moved in
evermore (deluxe version),Sleeps in Este's bed and everything
evermore (deluxe version),"No, there ain't no doubt"
evermore (deluxe version),"Somebody's gotta catch him out, 'cause"
evermore (deluxe version),"I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)"
evermore (deluxe version),"I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)"
evermore (deluxe version),"I think he did it, but I just can't prove it"
evermore (deluxe version),"No, no body, no crime"
evermore (deluxe version),But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die
evermore (deluxe version),"No, no"
evermore (deluxe version),I think he did it
evermore (deluxe version),"No, no"
evermore (deluxe version),He did it
evermore (deluxe version),Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen
evermore (deluxe version),And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
evermore (deluxe version),Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me
evermore (deluxe version),"(She was with me, dude)"
evermore (deluxe version),Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy
evermore (deluxe version),"They think she did it, but they just can't prove it"
evermore (deluxe version),"They think she did it, but they just can't prove it"
evermore (deluxe version),"She thinks I did it, but she just can't prove it"
evermore (deluxe version),"No, no body, no crime"
evermore (deluxe version),I wasn't lettin' up until the day he—
evermore (deluxe version),"No, no body, no crime"
evermore (deluxe version),I wasn't lettin' up until the day he—
evermore (deluxe version),"No, no body, no crime"
evermore (deluxe version),I wasn't lettin' up until the day he died
evermore (deluxe version),"Honey, when I'm above the trees"
evermore (deluxe version),I see this for what it is
evermore (deluxe version),"But now I'm right down in it, all the years I've given"
evermore (deluxe version),Is just shit we're dividin' up
evermore (deluxe version),Showed you all of my hiding spots
evermore (deluxe version),I was dancing when the music stopped
evermore (deluxe version),"And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention"
evermore (deluxe version),I haven't met the new me yet
evermore (deluxe version),There'll be happiness after you
evermore (deluxe version),But there was happiness because of you
evermore (deluxe version),Both of these things can be true
evermore (deluxe version),There is happiness
evermore (deluxe version),Past the blood and bruise
evermore (deluxe version),Past the curses and cries
evermore (deluxe version),Beyond the terror in the nightfall
evermore (deluxe version),Haunted by the look in my eyes
evermore (deluxe version),That would've loved you for a lifetime
evermore (deluxe version),Leave it all behind
evermore (deluxe version),And there is happiness
evermore (deluxe version),"Tell me, when did your winning smile"
evermore (deluxe version),Begin to look like a smirk?
evermore (deluxe version),When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
evermore (deluxe version),Pointed at my deepest hurt?
evermore (deluxe version),I hope she'll be a beautiful fool
evermore (deluxe version),Who takes my spot next to you
evermore (deluxe version),"No, I didn't mean that"
evermore (deluxe version),"Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury"
evermore (deluxe version),You haven't met the new me yet
evermore (deluxe version),There'll be happiness after me
evermore (deluxe version),But there was happiness because of me
evermore (deluxe version),"Both of these things, I believe"
evermore (deluxe version),There is happiness
evermore (deluxe version),"In our history, across our great divide"
evermore (deluxe version),There is a glorious sunrise
evermore (deluxe version),Dappled with the flickers of light
evermore (deluxe version),"From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind"
evermore (deluxe version),And there is happiness
evermore (deluxe version),I can't make it go away by making you a villain
evermore (deluxe version),I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven
evermore (deluxe version),And I pulled your body into mine
evermore (deluxe version),"Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties"
evermore (deluxe version),No one teaches you what to do
evermore (deluxe version),When a good man hurts you
evermore (deluxe version),And you know you hurt him too
evermore (deluxe version),"Honey, when I'm above the trees"
evermore (deluxe version),I see it for what it is
evermore (deluxe version),But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
evermore (deluxe version),After giving you the best I had
evermore (deluxe version),Tell me what to give after that
evermore (deluxe version),All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
evermore (deluxe version),You haven't met the new me yet
evermore (deluxe version),And I think she'll give you that
evermore (deluxe version),There'll be happiness after you
evermore (deluxe version),But there was happiness because of you too
evermore (deluxe version),Both of these things can be true
evermore (deluxe version),There is happiness
evermore (deluxe version),"In our history, across our great divide"
evermore (deluxe version),There is a glorious sunrise
evermore (deluxe version),Dappled with the flickers of light
evermore (deluxe version),"From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind"
evermore (deluxe version),"Oh, leave it all behind"
evermore (deluxe version),Leave it all behind
evermore (deluxe version),And there is happiness
evermore (deluxe version),"Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?"
evermore (deluxe version),When we were younger down in the park
evermore (deluxe version),"Honey, making a lark of the misery"
evermore (deluxe version),You got shiny friends since you left town
evermore (deluxe version),A tiny screen's the only place I see you now
evermore (deluxe version),And I got nothing but well wishes for ya
evermore (deluxe version),"Ooh, this place is the same as it ever was"
evermore (deluxe version),"Ooh, but you won't like it that way"
evermore (deluxe version),It's never too late to come back to my side
evermore (deluxe version),The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
evermore (deluxe version),And if you're ever tired of bеing known for who you know
evermore (deluxe version),"You know that you'll always know me, Dorothea (Uh-uh)"
evermore (deluxe version),Dorothea (Ah-ah)
evermore (deluxe version),"Ooh, you'rе a queen sellin' dreams, sellin' makeup and magazines"
evermore (deluxe version),"Ooh, from you, I'd buy anything"
evermore (deluxe version),"Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?"
evermore (deluxe version),"When it was calmer, skipping the prom just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes"
evermore (deluxe version),"And damn, Dorothea, they all wanna be ya"
evermore (deluxe version),But are you still the same soul I met under the bleachers? Well
evermore (deluxe version),"Ooh, I guess I'll never know"
evermore (deluxe version),"Ooh, and you'll go on with the show"
evermore (deluxe version),But it's never too late to come back to my side
evermore (deluxe version),The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
evermore (deluxe version),And if you're ever tired of being known for who you know
evermore (deluxe version),"You know, you'll always know me, Dorothea (Uh-uh)"
evermore (deluxe version),Dorothea (Ah-ah)
evermore (deluxe version),"Ooh, ooh"
evermore (deluxe version),"Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh"
evermore (deluxe version),"Ooh, ooh"
evermore (deluxe version),"Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh"
evermore (deluxe version),Dorothea (Ah-ah-ah)
evermore (deluxe version),Ah-ah
evermore (deluxe version),Ooh
evermore (deluxe version),Break my soul in two looking for you
evermore (deluxe version),But you're right here
evermore (deluxe version),If I can't relate to you anymore
evermore (deluxe version),Then who am I related to?
evermore (deluxe version),And if this is the long haul
evermore (deluxe version),How'd we get here so soon?
evermore (deluxe version),Did I close my fist around something delicate?
evermore (deluxe version),Did I shatter you?
evermore (deluxe version),And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island
evermore (deluxe version),Wondering where did my baby go?
evermore (deluxe version),"The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go"
evermore (deluxe version),Sorry for not making you my centerfold
evermore (deluxe version),Over and over
evermore (deluxe version),Lost again with no surprises
evermore (deluxe version),"Disappointments, close your eyes"
evermore (deluxe version),And it gets colder and colder
evermore (deluxe version),When the sun goes down
evermore (deluxe version),The question pounds my head
evermore (deluxe version),What's a lifetime of achievement
evermore (deluxe version),If I pushed you to the edge?
evermore (deluxe version),But you were too polite to leave me
evermore (deluxe version),And do you miss the rogue
evermore (deluxe version),Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
evermore (deluxe version),Will you forgive my soul
evermore (deluxe version),When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?
evermore (deluxe version),'Cause we were like the mall before the internet
evermore (deluxe version),It was the one place to be
evermore (deluxe version),"The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams"
evermore (deluxe version),Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring
evermore (deluxe version),Over and over
evermore (deluxe version),Lost again with no surprises
evermore (deluxe version),"Disappointments, close your eyes"
evermore (deluxe version),And it gets colder and colder
evermore (deluxe version),When the sun goes down
evermore (deluxe version),Were you waiting at our old spot
evermore (deluxe version),In the tree line
evermore (deluxe version),By the gold clock
evermore (deluxe version),Did I leave you hanging every single day?
evermore (deluxe version),Were you standing in the hallway
evermore (deluxe version),"With a big cake, happy birthday"
evermore (deluxe version),Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?
evermore (deluxe version),A universe away
evermore (deluxe version),And when I got into the accident
evermore (deluxe version),The sight that flashed before me was your face
evermore (deluxe version),"But when I walked up to the podium, I think that I forgot to say your name"
evermore (deluxe version),I'm on a bench in Coney Island
evermore (deluxe version),Wondering where did my baby go?
evermore (deluxe version),"The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go"
evermore (deluxe version),Sorry for not making you my centerfold
evermore (deluxe version),Over and over
evermore (deluxe version),Lost again with no surprises
evermore (deluxe version),"Disappointments, close your eyes"
evermore (deluxe version),And it gets colder and colder
evermore (deluxe version),When the sun goes down
evermore (deluxe version),When the sun goes down
evermore (deluxe version),The sight that flashed before me was your face
evermore (deluxe version),When the sun goes down
evermore (deluxe version),But I think that I forgot to say your name
evermore (deluxe version),Over and over
evermore (deluxe version),"Sorry for not making you my, making you my"
evermore (deluxe version),Making you my centerfold
evermore (deluxe version),How's one to know?
evermore (deluxe version),I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones
evermore (deluxe version),In a faith-forgotten land
evermore (deluxe version),In from the snow
evermore (deluxe version),Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
evermore (deluxe version),Tarnished but so grand
evermore (deluxe version),And the old widow goes to the stone every day
evermore (deluxe version),"But I don't, I just sit here and wait"
evermore (deluxe version),Grieving for the living
evermore (deluxe version),"Oh, goddamn"
evermore (deluxe version),My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
evermore (deluxe version),"Taking mine, but it's been promised to another"
evermore (deluxe version),"Oh, I can't"
evermore (deluxe version),Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
evermore (deluxe version),"My house of stone, your ivy grows"
evermore (deluxe version),And now I'm covered in you
evermore (deluxe version),I wish to know
evermore (deluxe version),The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
evermore (deluxe version),Magnificently cursed
evermore (deluxe version),He's in the room
evermore (deluxe version),Your opal eyes are all I wish to see
evermore (deluxe version),He wants what's only yours
evermore (deluxe version),"Oh, goddamn"
evermore (deluxe version),My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
evermore (deluxe version),"Taking mine, but it's been promised to another"
evermore (deluxe version),"Oh, I can't"
evermore (deluxe version),Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
evermore (deluxe version),"My house of stone, your ivy grows"
evermore (deluxe version),And now I'm covered
evermore (deluxe version),Clover blooms in the fields
evermore (deluxe version),"Spring breaks loose, the time is near"
evermore (deluxe version),What would he do if he found us out?
evermore (deluxe version),"Crescent moon, coast is clear"
evermore (deluxe version),"Spring breaks loose, but so does fear"
evermore (deluxe version),He's gonna burn this house to the ground
evermore (deluxe version),How's one to know?
evermore (deluxe version),I'd live and die for moments that we stole
evermore (deluxe version),On begged and borrowed time
evermore (deluxe version),So tell me to run
evermore (deluxe version),Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become
evermore (deluxe version),And drink my husband's wine
evermore (deluxe version),"Oh, goddamn"
evermore (deluxe version),My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
evermore (deluxe version),"Taking mine, but it's been promised to another"
evermore (deluxe version),"Oh, I can't"
evermore (deluxe version),Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
evermore (deluxe version),"My house of stone, your ivy grows"
evermore (deluxe version),And now I'm covered in you
evermore (deluxe version),And I'm covered in you
evermore (deluxe version),"So yeah, it's a fire"
evermore (deluxe version),It's a goddamn blaze in the dark
evermore (deluxe version),And you started it
evermore (deluxe version),You started it
evermore (deluxe version),"So yeah, it's a war"
evermore (deluxe version),It's the goddamn fight of my life
evermore (deluxe version),And you started it
evermore (deluxe version),You started it
evermore (deluxe version),"Oh, I can't"
evermore (deluxe version),Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
evermore (deluxe version),"My house of stone, your ivy grows"
evermore (deluxe version),And now I'm covered
evermore (deluxe version),"In you, in you"
evermore (deluxe version),Now I'm covered in you
evermore (deluxe version),In you
evermore (deluxe version),And the tennis court was covered up
evermore (deluxe version),With some tent-like thing
evermore (deluxe version),And you asked me to dance
evermore (deluxe version),"But I said, ""Dancin' is a dangerous game"""
evermore (deluxe version),"Oh, I thought"
evermore (deluxe version),This is gonna be one of those things
evermore (deluxe version),Now I know
evermore (deluxe version),I'm never gonna love again
evermore (deluxe version),I've got some tricks up my sleeve
evermore (deluxe version),Takes one to know one
evermore (deluxe version),You're a cowboy like me
evermore (deluxe version),Never wanted love
evermore (deluxe version),Just a fancy car
evermore (deluxe version),Now I'm waiting by the phone
evermore (deluxe version),Like I'm sitting in an airport bar
evermore (deluxe version),You had some tricks up your sleeve
evermore (deluxe version),Takes one to know one
evermore (deluxe version),You're a cowboy like me
evermore (deluxe version),Perched in the dark
evermore (deluxe version),Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
evermore (deluxe version),Like it could be love
evermore (deluxe version),I could be the way forward
evermore (deluxe version),Only if they pay for it
evermore (deluxe version),You're a bandit like me
evermore (deluxe version),Eyes full of stars
evermore (deluxe version),Hustling for the good life

evermore (deluxe version),We could be the way forward
evermore (deluxe version),And I know I'll pay for it
evermore (deluxe version),And the skeletons in both our closets
evermore (deluxe version),Plotted hard to fuck this up
evermore (deluxe version),And the old men that I've swindled
evermore (deluxe version),Really did believe I was the one
evermore (deluxe version),And the ladies lunching have their stories about
evermore (deluxe version),When you passed through town
evermore (deluxe version),But that was all before I locked it down
evermore (deluxe version),Now you hang from my lips

evermore (deluxe version),And you passed right by
evermore (deluxe version),"I was in the alley, surrounded on all sides"
evermore (deluxe version),The knife cuts both ways
evermore (deluxe version),"If the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break"
evermore (deluxe version),And I fell from the pedestal
evermore (deluxe version),Right down the rabbit hole
evermore (deluxe version),"Long story short, it was a bad time"
evermore (deluxe version),Pushed from the precipice
evermore (deluxe version),Clung to the nearest lips
evermore (deluxe version),"Long story short, it was the wrong guy"
evermore (deluxe version),Now I'm all about you
evermore (deluxe version),"I'm all about you, ah"
evermore (deluxe version),"Yeah, yeah"
evermore (deluxe version),"I'm all about you, ah"

evermore (deluxe version),Actually
evermore (deluxe version),I always felt I must look better in the rear view
evermore (deluxe version),Missing me
evermore (deluxe version),At the golden gates they once held the keys to
evermore (deluxe version),When I dropped my sword
evermore (deluxe version),I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
evermore (deluxe version),And we live in peace
evermore (deluxe version),"But if someone comes at us, this time, I'm ready"
evermore (deluxe version),'Cause I fell from the pedestal
evermore (deluxe version),Right down the rabbit hole
evermore (deluxe version),"Long story short, it was a bad time"
evermore (deluxe version),Pushed from the precipice
evermore (deluxe version),Clung to the nearest lips
evermore (deluxe version),"Long story short, it was the wrong guy"

evermore (deluxe version),Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)
evermore (deluxe version),And my waves meet your shore
evermore (deluxe version),Ever and evermore
evermore (deluxe version),Past me
evermore (deluxe version),I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things
evermore (deluxe version),Your nemeses
evermore (deluxe version),Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing
evermore (deluxe version),And he's passing by
evermore (deluxe version),Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
evermore (deluxe version),And he feels like home
evermore (deluxe version),"If the shoe fits, walk in it everywhere you go"
evermore (deluxe version),And I fell from the pedestal
evermore (deluxe version),Right down the rabbit hole
evermore (deluxe version),"Long story short, it was a bad time"

evermore (deluxe version),"You're alive, so alive"
evermore (deluxe version),The autumn chill that wakes me up
evermore (deluxe version),You loved the amber skies so much
evermore (deluxe version),Long limbs and frozen swims
evermore (deluxe version),You'd always go past where our feet could touch
evermore (deluxe version),And I complained the whole way there
evermore (deluxe version),The car ride back and up the stairs
evermore (deluxe version),I should've asked you questions
evermore (deluxe version),I should've asked you how to be
evermore (deluxe version),Asked you to write it down for me
evermore (deluxe version),Should've kept every grocery store receipt
evermore (deluxe version),'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
evermore (deluxe version),Watched as you signed your name Marjorie

evermore (deluxe version),I know better
evermore (deluxe version),But I still feel you all around
evermore (deluxe version),I know better
evermore (deluxe version),But you're still around
evermore (deluxe version),It's been a long time
evermore (deluxe version),And seeing the shape of your name
evermore (deluxe version),Still spells out pain
evermore (deluxe version),It wasn't right
evermore (deluxe version),The way it all went down
evermore (deluxe version),Looks like you know that now

evermore (deluxe version),I know I'm just a wrinkle in your new life
evermore (deluxe version),Staying friends would iron it out so nice
evermore (deluxe version),"Guilty, guilty, reaching out across the sea"
evermore (deluxe version),That you put between you and me
evermore (deluxe version),But it's fake and it's oh so unnecessary

evermore (deluxe version),Gray November
evermore (deluxe version),I've been down since July
evermore (deluxe version),Motion capture
evermore (deluxe version),Put me in a bad light
evermore (deluxe version),I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
evermore (deluxe version),Trying to find the one where I went wrong
evermore (deluxe version),Writing letters
evermore (deluxe version),Addressed to the fire
evermore (deluxe version),And I was catching my breath
evermore (deluxe version),Staring out an open window
evermore (deluxe version),Catching my death
evermore (deluxe version),And I couldn't be sure
evermore (deluxe version),I had a feeling so peculiar
evermore (deluxe version),That this pain would be for
evermore (deluxe version),Evermore
evermore (deluxe version),Hey December
evermore (deluxe version),Guess I'm feeling unmoored
evermore (deluxe version),Can't remember
evermore (deluxe version),What I used to fight for
evermore (deluxe version),"I rewind thе tape, but all it does is pause"
evermore (deluxe version),On thе very moment all was lost
evermore (deluxe version),Sending signals
evermore (deluxe version),To be double-crossed
evermore (deluxe version),And I was catching my breath
evermore (deluxe version),Barefoot in the wildest winter
evermore (deluxe version),Catching my death
evermore (deluxe version),And I couldn't be sure
evermore (deluxe version),I had a feeling so peculiar
evermore (deluxe version),That this pain would be for
evermore (deluxe version),Evermore
evermore (deluxe version),(Evermore)
evermore (deluxe version),Can't not think of all the cost
evermore (deluxe version),And the things that will be lost
evermore (deluxe version),"Oh, can we just get a pause?"
evermore (deluxe version),"To be certain, we'll be tall again"
evermore (deluxe version),Whether weather be the frost
evermore (deluxe version),Or the violence of the dog days
evermore (deluxe version),"I'm on waves, out being tossed"
evermore (deluxe version),Is there a line that I could just go cross?
evermore (deluxe version),And when I was shipwrecked (Can't think of all the cost)
evermore (deluxe version),I thought of you (All the things that will be lost now)
evermore (deluxe version),In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause?)
evermore (deluxe version),"I dreamed of you (To be certain we'll be tall again, if you think of all the costs)"
evermore (deluxe version),It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost)
evermore (deluxe version),To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days)
evermore (deluxe version),(Or the violence of the dog days)
evermore (deluxe version),"(Out on waves, being tossed)"
evermore (deluxe version),"(I'm on waves, out being tossed)"
evermore (deluxe version),I swear (Is there a line that we can just go cross?)
evermore (deluxe version),You were there
evermore (deluxe version),And I was catching my breath
evermore (deluxe version),Floors of a cabin creaking under my step
evermore (deluxe version),And I couldn't be sure
evermore (deluxe version),I had a feeling so peculiar
evermore (deluxe version),This pain wouldn't be for
evermore (deluxe version),Evermore
evermore (deluxe version),Evermore
evermore (deluxe version),Evermore
evermore (deluxe version),This pain wouldn't be for evermore
evermore (deluxe version),Evermore
evermore (deluxe version),"Friends break up, friends get married"

evermore (deluxe version),"Trends change, rumors fly through new skies"
evermore (deluxe version),But I'm right where you left me
evermore (deluxe version),Matches burn after the other
evermore (deluxe version),Pages turn and stick to each other
evermore (deluxe version),Wages earned and lessons learned
evermore (deluxe version),"But I, I'm right where you left me"
evermore (deluxe version),"Help, I'm still at the restaurant"
evermore (deluxe version),Still sitting in a corner I haunt
evermore (deluxe version),Cross-legged in the dim light
evermore (deluxe version),"They say, ""What a sad sight"""
evermore (deluxe version),"I, I swear you could hear a hair pin drop"
evermore (deluxe version),Right when I felt the moment stop
evermore (deluxe version),Glass shattered on the white cloth
evermore (deluxe version),"Everybody moved on, I, I stayed there"
evermore (deluxe version),Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
evermore (deluxe version),They expected me to find somewhere
evermore (deluxe version),"Some perspective, but I sat and stared"
evermore (deluxe version),Right where you left me
evermore (deluxe version),"You left me no, you left me no"
evermore (deluxe version),You left me no choice but to stay here forever
evermore (deluxe version),"You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no"
evermore (deluxe version),You left me no choice but to stay here forever
evermore (deluxe version),Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen?
evermore (deluxe version),"Time went on for everybody else, she won't know it"
evermore (deluxe version),She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
evermore (deluxe version),How it was supposed to be
evermore (deluxe version),Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion?
evermore (deluxe version),"Breakups happen every day, you don't have to lose it"
evermore (deluxe version),She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
evermore (deluxe version),And you're sitting in front of me
evermore (deluxe version),At the restaurant when I was still the one you want
evermore (deluxe version),"Cross-legged in the dim light, everything was just right"
evermore (deluxe version),"I, I could feel the mascara run"
evermore (deluxe version),You told me that you met someone
evermore (deluxe version),Glass shattered on the white cloth
evermore (deluxe version),Everybody moved on
evermore (deluxe version),"Help, I'm still at the restaurant"
evermore (deluxe version),Still sitting in a corner I haunt
evermore (deluxe version),Cross-legged in the dim light
evermore (deluxe version),"They say, ""What a sad sight"""
evermore (deluxe version),"I, I stayed there"
evermore (deluxe version),Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
evermore (deluxe version),I'm sure that you got a wife out there
evermore (deluxe version),"Kids and Christmas, but I'm unaware"
evermore (deluxe version),'Cause I'm right where I cause no harm
evermore (deluxe version),Mind my business
evermore (deluxe version),If our love died young
evermore (deluxe version),I can't bear witness
evermore (deluxe version),And it's been so long
evermore (deluxe version),But if you ever think you got it wrong
evermore (deluxe version),I'm right where
evermore (deluxe version),You left me

evermore (deluxe version),When the dinner is cold and the chatter gets old
evermore (deluxe version),You ask for the tab
evermore (deluxe version),"Or that moment again, he's insisting that friends"

evermore (deluxe version),When the words of a sister come back in whispers
evermore (deluxe version),That prove she was not in fact what she seemed
evermore (deluxe version),Not a twin from your dreams
evermore (deluxe version),She's a crook who was caught
evermore (deluxe version),That old familiar body ache
evermore (deluxe version),The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
evermore (deluxe version),You know when it's time to go
evermore (deluxe version),Twenty years at your job
evermore (deluxe version),Then the son of the boss gets the spot that was yours
evermore (deluxe version),Or trying to stay for the kids
evermore (deluxe version),When keeping it how it is will only break their hearts worse
evermore (deluxe version),That old familiar body ache
evermore (deluxe version),The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
evermore (deluxe version),You know when it's time to go
evermore (deluxe version),Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
evermore (deluxe version),Sometimes to run is the brave thing
evermore (deluxe version),Sometimes walking out is the one thing
evermore (deluxe version),That will find you the right thing
